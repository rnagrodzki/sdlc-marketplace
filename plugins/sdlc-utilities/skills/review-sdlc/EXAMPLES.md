# CI/CD Pipeline Review

Review pipeline definitions for correctness, security, and efficiency.

## Checklist

- [ ] No secrets or tokens hardcoded in workflow files — use repository/org secrets
- [ ] `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions are scoped to the minimum required (`contents: read`, etc.)

- [ ] Cache keys are content-addressed (e.g., hash of lockfile) to avoid stale caches
- [ ] Cache restore uses fallback keys to avoid full cache misses on first run
- [ ] Pinned action versions use full SHA commit hashes, not mutable tags (`@v3`)
- [ ] Test and lint jobs fail fast — `fail-fast: true` or equivalent
- [ ] Artifact upload/download steps reference consistent names between jobs
- [ ] Environment-specific secrets are scoped to the correct environment (`environment:`)
- [ ] Workflow triggers are appropriately scoped — not running on every push to all branches
- [ ] No `continue-on-error: true` masking real failures in critical steps
- [ ] Matrix strategies do not include unnecessary combinations

# Database Migrations Review

Review migration files for correctness, safety, and reversibility.

## Checklist

- [ ] Migrations are numbered/timestamped and will apply in the correct order
- [ ] Each migration has a corresponding rollback / down migration
- [ ] No destructive operations (`DROP COLUMN`, `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`) without a data backup plan
- [ ] Column additions use `DEFAULT` values or are nullable to avoid locking issues on large tables
- [ ] Indexes are created `CONCURRENTLY` (PostgreSQL) or equivalent to avoid table locks
- [ ] No raw data transformations that could fail mid-migration and leave data inconsistent
- [ ] Foreign key constraints are added after data is in a consistent state
- [ ] Migration does not mix schema changes with data backfills in the same transaction
- [ ] Backfill migrations are idempotent (safe to re-run)
- [ ] No hardcoded environment-specific values (connection strings, schema names)
- [ ] Migration file name follows project conventions (timestamp prefix, descriptive name)

## Severity Guide

| Finding | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| Destructive operation without safety net | critical |
| Non-idempotent data migration | critical |

# Error Handling Review

Review error handling for consistency, context preservation, and safe failure modes.

## Checklist

- [ ] Errors are not silently swallowed — catch blocks either handle or re-throw
- [ ] Error context is preserved when wrapping errors (original cause attached)
- [ ] User-facing error messages are actionable — they explain what happened and what to do
- [ ] Internal error details (stack traces, raw DB errors) are not exposed to end users
- [ ] Async operations handle errors explicitly — no unhandled promise rejections
- [ ] Retry logic uses exponential backoff and has a maximum retry limit
- [ ] Circuit breaker or fallback strategy exists for external service calls
- [ ] Error types are specific enough to distinguish recoverable from non-recoverable errors
- [ ] HTTP error responses use semantically correct status codes
- [ ] Cleanup / resource release happens in finally blocks or equivalent, not only in the happy path
- [ ] Errors that should alert on-call are logged at the appropriate level (error/fatal vs warn)

## Severity Guide

| Finding | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| Silent catch block (error swallowed, no log) | high |
| Internal error details exposed to end user | high |
| Unhandled promise rejection / uncaught async error | high |
| Error context lost when re-throwing | medium |
| Retry without backoff or max limit | medium |
| Resource leak in error path | medium |
| Generic catch-all with no error type distinction | low |
| Non-actionable user-facing error message | low |

# Accessibility Review

Review UI changes for accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA).

## Checklist

- [ ] Interactive elements (`<button>`, `<a>`, custom components) have accessible names (text content or `aria-label`)
- [ ] Images have meaningful `alt` text; decorative images use `alt=""`
- [ ] Form inputs are associated with labels via `<label for>` or `aria-labelledby`
- [ ] Error messages are associated with their input via `aria-describedby`
- [ ] Focus is managed correctly after dynamic content changes (modals, toasts, route transitions)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works without a mouse — all interactive elements reachable via Tab
- [ ] Focus indicators are visible — not removed with `outline: none` without a replacement style
- [ ] Color is not the only means of conveying information
- [ ] Text contrast meets WCAG AA ratio (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
- [ ] ARIA roles, states, and properties are used correctly — not redundant or conflicting
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44×44px on mobile
- [ ] Dynamic content updates (live regions) use `aria-live` appropriately

## Severity Guide

| Finding | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| Interactive element with no accessible name | high |
| Form input with no label | high |
| Focus trapped or lost after modal/dialog | high |
| Keyboard navigation broken for interactive element | high |
| Contrast ratio below WCAG AA | medium |
| Missing `alt` on informative image | medium |
| ARIA role/state used incorrectly | medium |
| Focus indicator removed without replacement | medium |
| Touch target below 44×44px | low |
