## 0. JSON Manifest Schema

`skill/review.js` outputs this JSON to stdout. The orchestrator agent reads it.

}
```

`status` values: `ACTIVE`, `SKIPPED`, `TRUNCATED`, `QUEUED`

### Per-dimension slice file

The `dimensions[]` array is a **thin index** — it carries no `body`, `matched_files`, `file_context`, or `warnings`. For each dispatched dimension (`status` ACTIVE/TRUNCATED), `review.js` writes a separate slice file into `diff_dir` and stores its path in `slice_file`. Non-dispatched dimensions (SKIPPED/QUEUED) have `slice_file: null`. This bounds the orchestrator's context by dimension **count**, not content — the orchestrator forwards `slice_file` + `diff_file` paths into each dispatch and never reads their contents itself.

Each `${diff_dir}/${name}.slice.json` has this shape:

```json
{
  "body": "# Security Review\n...",
  "matched_files": ["src/auth/login.ts"],
  "file_context": [
    {
      "file": "src/auth/login.ts",
      "commits": [{ "hash": "abc1234", "subject": "feat: add OAuth2 flow" }]
    }
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

`scope` values:

- `all` (default) — committed branch changes + staged changes (`git diff --cached {base}`)
- `committed` — committed branch changes only (`git diff {base}..HEAD`)
- `staged` — staged changes vs HEAD only (`git diff --cached`)
- `working` — all uncommitted changes vs HEAD, staged + unstaged (`git diff HEAD`)
- `worktree` — full working tree vs base: committed + staged + unstaged (`git diff {base}`)

When `scope` is `staged` or `working`: `base_branch` is `null`, `git.commit_count` is `0`, and `file_context[].commits` arrays (in each dimension's slice file) are empty. `pr` is `{ exists: false }`.

When `scope` is `worktree`: `base_branch` is set, `git.commit_count` reflects commits since base, and `file_context[].commits` arrays (in each dimension's slice file) are populated. The diff additionally includes unstaged working tree changes. `pr` is populated if a PR exists. Note: untracked files (never `git add`-ed) are not included.

## 1. Dimension File Format

Each project defines review dimensions as `.md` files in `<project>/.sdlc/review-dimensions/`.

### Schema

```yaml
---
name: <string>              # REQUIRED. Lowercase letters, digits, hyphens. Max 64 chars. Unique.
description: <string>       # REQUIRED. What this dimension reviews. Max 256 chars.
triggers:                   # REQUIRED. Non-empty array of glob patterns. At least one pattern.
  - "**/*.pattern"
  - "**/directory/**"
skip-when:                  # OPTIONAL. Negative globs — matched files are excluded even if triggers match.
  - "**/*.md"
  - "**/testdata/**"
severity: medium            # OPTIONAL. Default: medium. One of: critical | high | medium | low | info
max-files: 100              # OPTIONAL. Default: 100. Positive integer. Files over this limit are truncated with a warning.
requires-full-diff: false   # OPTIONAL. Default: false. If true, subagent receives the full diff for matched files.
---

[Review instructions body — free-form Markdown, minimum 10 characters]
```

### Field reference

| Field | Required | Type | Default | Constraints |
|-------|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | string | — | Lowercase, digits, hyphens; max 64 chars; unique across all dimension files |
| `description` | Yes | string | — | Non-empty; max 256 chars |
| `triggers` | Yes | string[] | — | Non-empty array; each must be valid glob syntax |
| `skip-when` | No | string[] | `[]` | Each must be valid glob syntax |
| `severity` | No | string | `medium` | One of: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info` |
| `max-files` | No | integer | `100` | Positive integer |
| `requires-full-diff` | No | boolean | `false` | — |
| `model` | No | string | `null` | One of: `haiku`, `sonnet`, `opus`. Per-dimension model override; falls back to `manifest.subagent_model` when null. Claude-Code-only — Copilot transform omits it. |

### Body content

The Markdown body below the frontmatter contains the review instructions passed verbatim to the subagent.
There is no enforced section structure — the author decides what the subagent needs.

Recommended elements:
- A brief statement of the dimension's focus
- A checklist of specific things to look for
- A severity guide (what constitutes critical vs. high vs. medium for this dimension)
- Project-specific context (e.g., "This project uses Express.js — check for missing middleware")

## 2. Subagent Prompt Template

When the orchestrator dispatches a review subagent for a dimension, it fills this template. The orchestrator forwards the dimension's `slice_file` and `diff_file` **paths** (from the thin manifest index) — it does NOT read their contents into its own context. The subagent reads them itself.

```
# Code Review: {dimension.name}

## Your Role
You are a code reviewer focused exclusively on: {dimension.description}

## Your Input Files
You MUST read both of these files before reviewing:

- **Slice file** (JSON): `{dimension.slice_file}`
  Read it and parse the JSON. It contains:
  - `body` — your full review instructions (Markdown)
  - `matched_files` — the list of changed files in your scope (review ONLY these)
  - `file_context` — array of `{ file, commits: [{ hash, subject }] }` for author-intent context
  - `warnings` — any prepare-time warnings (e.g., matched files with no diff content)
- **Diff file**: `{dimension.diff_file}`
  Read it for the pre-filtered diff hunks covering your matched files.

## How to Use Them
1. `Read({dimension.slice_file})` and parse the JSON.
2. Treat the parsed `body` as your Review Instructions — follow it verbatim.
3. Review ONLY the files in `matched_files`.
4. For each `file_context` entry whose `commits` array is non-empty, use the commit hashes/subjects to understand the author's intent. When all `commits` arrays are empty, there is no commit context (e.g., reviewing staged/working changes).
5. `Read({dimension.diff_file})` for the diff to review.
6. Surface any `warnings` entries that affect your review (e.g., a matched file with no diff content).

## Default Severity
Unless the review instructions specify otherwise, classify findings as: {dimension.severity}

## Output Format
Return your findings as a structured list. Each finding MUST follow this exact format:

### Finding N
- **File**: {relative file path}
- **Line**: {line number or range, e.g., 42 or 42-48}
- **Severity**: {critical|high|medium|low|info}
- **OWASP**: {A01–A10, OPTIONAL — populate ONLY when the dimension body instructs OWASP tagging; omit this line entirely for any other dimension}
- **Title**: {one-line summary, max 80 chars}
- **Description**: {what is wrong and why it matters, 1-3 sentences}
- **Suggestion**: {how to fix it, 1-3 sentences — "N/A" if no clear fix}

## Constraints
- Review ONLY the files listed above — do not read other files
- Review ONLY for the concerns described in the review instructions — stay in scope
- If you find ZERO issues, explicitly state: "No findings for this dimension."
- Do NOT fabricate issues
- Each finding must reference a specific file and line number
- Maximum 20 findings (prioritize by severity if more exist)
```

**Diff scoping:**
- When `requires-full-diff` is `false` (default): subagent receives only the diff hunks for its matched files
- When `requires-full-diff` is `true`: subagent receives the complete diff output for those files

## 3. Consolidated PR Comment Template

After all subagents complete and findings are deduplicated, post this as a single PR comment:

```markdown
## Code Review — {N} dimension(s), {M} finding(s)

> Automated review by `review-sdlc` v{plugin_version} · {date}

### Summary

| Dimension | Findings | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |
|-----------|----------|----------|------|--------|-----|------|
| {name} | {total} | {critical} | {high} | {medium} | {low} | {info} |
| **Total** | **{total}** | **{critical}** | **{high}** | **{medium}** | **{low}** | **{info}** |

### Verdict: {CHANGES REQUESTED | APPROVED WITH NOTES | APPROVED}

{One-sentence overall assessment}

---

### {dimension.name} — {N} finding(s)

<details>
<summary>{critical} critical · {high} high · {medium} medium · {low} low · {info} info</summary>

#### [{SEVERITY}] {title}
**File:** `{file}:{line}`{if OWASP set: ` · OWASP {OWASP}`}
{description}
**Suggestion:** {suggestion}

</details>

---
```

**Template variable `{plugin_version}`:** Resolved by the prepare script (`review.js`) and emitted as `manifest.plugin_version`. The orchestrator reads it from the manifest and substitutes it verbatim — the `v` prefix is part of the template, not the value.

**OWASP rendering rule:** When the finding contains an `**OWASP:**` value, append ` · OWASP {code}` to the File line (e.g., ``**File:** `src/auth/login.ts:42` · OWASP A07``). Omit the suffix entirely when the field is absent. The OWASP slot is opt-in per dimension — only dimensions whose body explicitly instructs OWASP tagging will populate it.

**Verdict computation:**
- `CHANGES REQUESTED` — any `critical` finding, or ≥ 3 `high` findings
- `APPROVED WITH NOTES` — any `high` finding, or ≥ 5 `medium` findings
- `APPROVED` — all other cases (low/info only, or nothing)

**Deduplication rule:** When two dimensions flag the same `file:line`, keep the finding from the higher-severity dimension. Add a note: "Also flagged by: {other dimension}."

**Contradiction rule:** When two dimensions give conflicting recommendations for the same `file:line`, keep both findings and add: "Note: conflicting recommendations — manual review required."
