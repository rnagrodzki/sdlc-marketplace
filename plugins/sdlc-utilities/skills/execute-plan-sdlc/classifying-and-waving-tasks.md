# Classifying Tasks and Building Waves

Reference for the `execute-plan-sdlc` skill — Step 2 (CLASSIFY).

## Complexity Classification Heuristics

| Signal | Complexity |
|---|---|
| Task mentions "rename", "update config", "change value", "add import" | Trivial |
| Task body is < 3 sentences with a single clear action | Trivial |
| Task creates or modifies 1 file with a well-defined output at a single location | Trivial |
| Task edits multiple distinct locations in a single file (e.g., struct + interface + init + getter) | Standard |
| Task creates or modifies 2–4 files with clear outputs | Standard |
| Task implements a feature, writes tests, adds a component | Standard |
| Task involves > 5 files or cross-cutting concerns | Complex |
| Task requires understanding multiple existing modules to implement correctly | Complex |
| Task involves architectural patterns or systemic changes | Complex |

When signals are mixed, round up (prefer higher complexity class).

## Risk Classification Heuristics

| Signal | Risk Level |
|---|---|
| Task touches only test files | Low |
| Task touches only documentation or comments | Low |
| Task creates new internal-only modules with no public surface | Low |
| Task modifies a public API or function signatures called by other modules | Medium |
| Task changes database schemas, migrations, or data models | Medium |
| Task modifies authentication, authorization, or session handling | High |
| Task changes infrastructure (Docker, k8s, CI/CD, deploy scripts) | High |
| Task involves credential management, secrets, or encryption | High |
| Task deletes files or removes existing functionality | High |
| Task touches shared state accessible by multiple services | High |

When signals are mixed, round up (prefer higher risk level).

## Model Assignment

Model assignment derives from the complexity class. The three presets in Step 4 apply these mappings across all tasks.

| Complexity | Default Model | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Trivial | `haiku` | Fast, cheap; frees main context for orchestration. Single trivial → execute inline. Two or more trivials in the same phase → dispatch as one batch agent. |
| Standard | `sonnet` | Capable, cost-efficient |
| Complex | `opus` | Most capable; needed for architectural work |

### Override signals

Assign `opus` to a Standard task when:
- The task involves unfamiliar or poorly documented code
- The task requires nuanced judgment (choosing between multiple valid approaches)
- A prior `sonnet` attempt on a similar task in this project failed

Assign `sonnet` to a Complex task when:
- The task is complex only because it touches many files, but each individual change is mechanical
- The changes are fully specified with exact code to write (no design judgment needed)

### Model Presets

Always present 3 presets in Step 4, regardless of plan size:

| Preset | Trivial | Standard | Complex | Best when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Speed** | haiku | haiku | sonnet | Plan is well-specified, changes are mechanical |
| **Balanced** | haiku | sonnet | opus | Default — matches complexity to capability |
| **Quality** | sonnet | opus | opus | Codebase is unfamiliar, tasks are ambiguous |

## Wave-Building Algorithm

1. **Build a dependency graph (DAG)** where an edge A → B means "task B depends on outputs from task A"
   - Identify explicit file dependencies: task B reads a file that task A creates
   - Identify implicit dependencies: task B modifies a module that task A adds to an index/barrel file

2. **Topological sort** the DAG to establish valid execution order

3. **Assign wave numbers:**
   - Wave 1: all tasks with no dependencies
   - Wave N+1: all tasks whose dependencies are all in waves ≤ N
   - Continue until all tasks are assigned

4. **Apply same-file constraint:** If two tasks in Wave N both modify the same file, move the later one (by plan order) to Wave N+1

5. **Apply adaptive wave size cap** (see table below). If a wave exceeds the cap, split the excess into Wave N+0.5 (insert a new wave between N and N+1)

6. **Apply risk spreading:** If a wave contains > 1 high-risk task, move the excess to the next wave

7. **Identify pre-wave trivials:** Trivial tasks that have downstream dependents in Wave 1 should run in the pre-wave. If there is only 1 pre-wave trivial, execute it inline. If there are 2+, dispatch them as a single batch agent (see Batched Trivial Tasks Prompt Template below).

8. **Identify in-wave trivial batches:** Within each wave, if 2 or more tasks are classified Trivial, dispatch them together as a single haiku batch agent rather than executing each inline. A single trivial task in a wave is still executed inline. Same-file ordering rules apply within the batch (see Batched Trivial Tasks Prompt Template below).

## Adaptive Wave Size Cap

Complex tasks count as 2 toward the cap (they consume more context and are more likely to conflict).

| Total remaining tasks | Max agents per wave |
|---|---|
| 1–3 | No cap (dispatch all) |
| 4–8 | 4 |
| 9–15 | 5 |
| 16+ | 6 |

On resource-constrained systems or when tasks share mutable state (databases, caches, singletons), reduce to 2–3 regardless of the table.

## Agent Prompt Template

Use this template for every agent dispatch in Step 5b. Fill all placeholders. Never abbreviate the task text or reference the plan file.

```
You are implementing a single task from a larger plan. Focus only on your assigned task.

## Your Task
{PASTE FULL TASK TEXT HERE — include title, description, acceptance criteria, and any notes from the plan. Never summarize or paraphrase.}

## Files You May Touch
{List every file the agent is allowed to create or modify. The agent must not modify files outside this list. If you are unsure of a file name, give the directory and a description.}
- path/to/file1.ts
- path/to/file2.ts
- (new file) path/to/new-file.ts

## Context From Prior Waves
{Summary of relevant changes already completed. Omit if this is Wave 1. Be specific: "Task 3 created UserService at src/services/user.service.ts with methods getUser(id) and createUser(data)." Not: "Task 3 was completed."}

## Completion Checklist (fill every line)

```
COMPLETE: files_created=[list or none] files_modified=[list or none] tests_added=[yes|no|n/a] tests_pass=[yes|no|n/a] build_pass=[yes|no|n/a]
VERIFY: <symbol_name> in <file_path>
STATUS: DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | NEEDS_CONTEXT | BLOCKED
```

**Status definitions:**
- **DONE** — task complete, no issues
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — task complete but you have doubts about correctness or approach; add explanation below the checklist block
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — cannot complete without additional information; describe what you need below the checklist block
- **BLOCKED** — cannot complete the task; describe the blocker and what you tried below the checklist block

For `VERIFY`, use the primary symbol you added or modified (function name, class name, config key, or constant). The orchestrator greps for this symbol to confirm your changes persisted in the filesystem.

## When You're in Over Your Head

It is always OK to stop and report BLOCKED. Bad work is worse than no work.

**STOP and report BLOCKED when:**
- The task requires architectural decisions with multiple valid approaches
- You need to understand code beyond what was provided and can't find clarity
- You feel uncertain about whether your approach is correct
- You've been reading files trying to understand the system without progress

The orchestrator can provide more context, escalate to a more capable model, break the task into smaller pieces, or escalate to the user.

## Hard Constraints
- Do NOT read the plan file — all task information is provided above
- Do NOT modify files outside the "Files You May Touch" list
- **Use the Edit tool exclusively for all file modifications.** Never use bash sed, awk, perl, Python scripts, Go programs, or any other indirect method to patch files. If a file needs changing, use Edit. No exceptions.
- If you encounter a genuine blocker, report it clearly rather than guessing or hallucinating an implementation
- Do not add features, refactor, or clean up code beyond what the task requires

## Before Reporting: Self-Review

Review your work before reporting. Check:

**Completeness:**
- Did you implement everything the task specifies?
- Are there edge cases you didn't handle?

**Discipline:**
- Did you only modify files in the "Files You May Touch" list?
- Did you avoid adding features, refactoring, or cleanup beyond the task scope?
- Did you use the Edit tool for every file modification (not bash/sed/awk)?

**Verification:**
- Did you run the verification steps specified in the task?
- Do the results confirm your changes work?

If you find issues during self-review, fix them before reporting.

## Execution Context
- Assigned model: {MODEL — haiku, sonnet, or opus}
- Permission mode: bypassPermissions (set explicitly on this agent — do not change).
- Attempt: {first attempt | retry N — previous attempt failed: {failure description}}
- {If model was escalated: "Model escalated from {previous-model} to {this-model} due to prior failure."}
```

## Batched Trivial Tasks Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching 2+ trivial tasks as a single batch agent. Fill all placeholders. Tasks are listed sequentially; the agent completes them in order.

~~~
You are implementing a batch of trivial tasks from a larger plan. Complete all tasks in the order listed. Each task is small and self-contained.

## Tasks (complete in order)

### Task {N}: {TASK TITLE}
{PASTE FULL TASK TEXT — include description, acceptance criteria, notes. Never summarize.}

Files you may touch for this task:
- path/to/file1
- path/to/file2

---

### Task {N+1}: {TASK TITLE}
{PASTE FULL TASK TEXT}

Files you may touch for this task:
- path/to/file3

---

(repeat for each task in the batch)

## Ordering Constraints
{List any same-file ordering requirements. Example: "Task 2 must complete before Task 3 — both modify config.ts and Task 3 depends on the key Task 2 adds." If none, write "None."}

## Context From Prior Waves
{Summary of relevant changes already completed. Omit if Wave 1. Be specific about interfaces, exports, and file locations.}

## Before Reporting: Self-Review (Quick)
For each task:
- Did you implement everything specified?
- Did you use the Edit tool exclusively (no bash/sed/awk)?
- Did you stay within the allowed file list?

## Expected Output
For each task, report:
1. Task title
2. Files created or modified (one-line summary per file)
3. Status: SUCCESS | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | FAILED
4. If DONE_WITH_CONCERNS: brief description of the concern
5. If FAILED: what went wrong and what was completed before failure

## Hard Constraints
- Complete tasks in the listed order
- Do NOT modify files outside each task's "Files you may touch" list
- **Use the Edit tool exclusively for all file modifications.** Never use bash sed, awk, perl, Python scripts, Go programs, or any other indirect method to patch files. If a file needs changing, use Edit. No exceptions.
- If one task fails, continue to the next — do not stop the batch
- Report per-task status even if some tasks fail
- Do not add features, refactor, or clean up beyond what each task requires

## Verification Tokens
After completing all tasks, report one verification token per task on its own line:
```
VERIFY Task {N}: <symbol_name> in <file_path>
```
Use the primary symbol added or modified in each task. The orchestrator greps for these symbols to confirm changes persisted.

## Execution Context
- Assigned model: {MODEL — haiku, sonnet, or opus}
- Permission mode: bypassPermissions (set explicitly on this agent — do not change).
- Attempt: {first attempt | retry N — previous attempt failed: {failure description}}
- {If model was escalated: "Model escalated from {previous-model} to {this-model} due to prior failure."}
~~~

## Common Dependency Patterns

These implicit dependencies are easy to miss:

| Scenario | Dependency |
|---|---|
| Task A creates a new module; Task B adds it to an index/barrel file | B depends on A |
| Task A defines a TypeScript type; Task B uses that type | B depends on A |
| Task A creates a database table; Task B seeds or queries it | B depends on A |
| Task A adds a config key; Task B reads that config key | B depends on A |
| Task A adds a route handler; Task B adds middleware that wraps all routes | Depends on order — check the framework's middleware registration semantics |
| Task A writes a test fixture; Task B writes tests that use that fixture | B depends on A |
