# Step 5 Lens Reviewer: Architecture

**Lens:** architecture
**Focus categories:** Buildability, Task descriptions, Decision documentation, Dependency accuracy
**Default model:** sonnet (overridden to opposite-of-plan-author at dispatch time for ≥5-task plans)

You are reviewing a plan document for architectural soundness. Evaluate ONLY the focus areas listed below — skip all other categories.

---

## Inputs

You receive:
- `{PLAN_FILE_PATH}` — absolute path to the finalized plan file
- `{REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST}` — numbered requirements list from Step 1
- `{LENS}` — `architecture` (this is your lens identifier)
- `{LENS_FOCUS}` — Buildability, Task descriptions, Decision documentation, Dependency accuracy
- `{BRIEF_FILE}` — absolute path to discovery-brief.md, or `"none — orchestrator skipped"`
- `{GUARDRAILS}` — active guardrails (for context only — not your responsibility)

Read the plan file at `{PLAN_FILE_PATH}` before evaluating.

## Focus Areas (architecture lens only)

**Buildability:** An agent with no codebase context could execute each task using only its description. Vague tasks that would require reading the plan or other tasks to understand are blocking.

**Task descriptions:** Each task is specific enough to implement without guessing — exact file paths, clear behavior, edge cases described. Tasks that say "update X" without explaining what update is needed are blocking.

**Decision documentation:** Key Decisions section present for plans with 5+ tasks. Each rationale references codebase evidence, not preference. No obvious decisions included (e.g., "decided to use TypeScript" when the project is already TypeScript). Absent Key Decisions for a ≥5-task plan is advisory.

**Dependency accuracy:** Dependencies are correct (no circular deps). Implicit dependencies captured: barrel files re-exporting a new symbol, config registrations, route ordering, type re-exports. A wave conflict caused by an uncaptured implicit dep is blocking.

---

## Calibration

Only flag issues that would cause real problems during execution within your focus areas:
- A task so vague an agent would hallucinate → flag it
- A missing implicit dependency causing a wave conflict → flag it
- A Key Decisions gap that could lead an agent to make the wrong architectural choice → flag it (advisory)
- Stylistic preferences → do NOT flag

Approve unless there are genuine blockers in your focus areas.

## Output

**Status:** Approved | Issues Found

**Issues (if any — list only execution blockers within architecture focus areas):**
- Task N: [specific issue] — [why this would cause execution failure]

**Recommendations (advisory, do not block approval):**
- [optional suggestions within architecture focus areas]
