# Plan Document Format Reference

Canonical format for implementation plans produced by `plan-sdlc` and consumed by `execute-plan-sdlc`. Both skills reference this document.

---

## Document Header (required)

Every plan document must begin with this header:

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this plan implements]
**Architecture:** [2–3 sentences about the overall approach and key design decisions]
**Source:** [Spec file path, or "conversation context" if no file]
**Verification:** [Primary verification command — e.g., "npm test", "go test ./...", "make test"]

---
```

All four fields are required. `execute-plan-sdlc` uses `Verification` as the default test command.

## Key Decisions (optional)

Capture architecture and design decisions made during planning that executing agents need to understand. Place this section between the document header and the first task block.

```markdown
## Key Decisions

- **[Choice A] over [Choice B]:** [Why — reference codebase patterns or constraints, not preference]
- **[Choice C] over [Choice D]:** [Why]
```

**What to include:**
- Choices where a reasonable implementer might choose differently without context
- Decisions backed by codebase evidence (e.g., "existing modules use pattern X in Y")
- Architecture decisions that affect multiple tasks

**What to skip:**
- Obvious decisions where only one reasonable option existed
- Stylistic preferences with no execution impact

Recommended for plans with 5+ tasks. Omit for simple plans. The Key Decisions section is free-text — `execute-plan-sdlc` does not parse it, but agents receive it as context alongside task descriptions.

---

## Guardrail Compliance (optional)

Present when `plan.guardrails` are configured in `.sdlc/config.json`. Produced by plan-sdlc Step 4.
`execute-plan-sdlc` does not parse this section — it documents constraint evaluation for reviewers.

```markdown
## Guardrail Compliance

| Guardrail | Severity | Status | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| no-direct-db-access | error | PASS | No tasks modify database schema files |
| prefer-composition | warning | PASS | No class hierarchies proposed |
```

---

## Per-Task Block (required for every task)

```markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Complexity:** Trivial | Standard | Complex
**Risk:** Low | Medium | High
**Depends on:** Task X, Task Y (or "none")
**Verify:** tests | build | lint | manual

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/relative/path/to/file.ts`
- Modify: `exact/relative/path/to/existing.ts` — [one line: what changes]
- Test: `tests/exact/relative/path/to/test.ts`

**Description:**
[Full description of what to implement: what to build, how it connects to existing code,
expected behavior, edge cases to handle. Include code snippets for non-obvious patterns.
Complete enough that an agent with no codebase context can execute it.]

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] [Specific, verifiable criterion]
- [ ] [Another criterion]
```

## Field Value Constraints

| Field | Allowed Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Complexity | `Trivial` \| `Standard` \| `Complex` | Used by execute-plan-sdlc for model assignment and wave building |
| Risk | `Low` \| `Medium` \| `High` | High-risk tasks trigger a user confirmation gate before execution |
| Depends on | `Task N, Task M` or `none` | Must reference tasks by their exact number; no forward references |
| Verify | `tests` \| `build` \| `lint` \| `manual` | Multiple allowed: `tests, build` |
| Files → Create | Relative path from project root | Must be exact — agents use this to know what to create |
| Files → Modify | Relative path + one-line description of change | Required if an existing file is modified |
| Files → Test | Relative path from project root | Omit row if task has no tests |

## Example Plan

```markdown
# User Authentication Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Add JWT-based authentication to the API server.
**Architecture:** Stateless JWT tokens validated by middleware; user records in the existing database; no session storage.
**Source:** docs/specs/auth-spec.md
**Verification:** npm test

---

### Task 1: JWT utility module

**Complexity:** Standard
**Risk:** Low
**Depends on:** none
**Verify:** tests

**Files:**
- Create: `src/utils/jwt.ts`
- Test: `tests/utils/jwt.test.ts`

**Description:**
Create a JWT utility module that exports `signToken(payload, expiresIn)` and `verifyToken(token)`.
Use the `jsonwebtoken` npm package (already installed). Sign with `process.env.JWT_SECRET`.
`verifyToken` should throw a typed error (`JwtExpiredError` | `JwtInvalidError`) on failure.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `signToken` returns a JWT string with the given payload
- [ ] `verifyToken` returns the decoded payload on valid tokens
- [ ] `verifyToken` throws `JwtExpiredError` on expired tokens
- [ ] `verifyToken` throws `JwtInvalidError` on malformed tokens
- [ ] Tests cover all four cases: sign, verify success, verify expired, verify invalid

---

### Task 2: Auth middleware

**Complexity:** Standard
**Risk:** Medium
**Depends on:** Task 1
**Verify:** tests

**Files:**
- Create: `src/middleware/auth.ts`
- Test: `tests/middleware/auth.test.ts`

**Description:**
Create Express middleware that reads the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header,
calls `verifyToken` from Task 1, and attaches the decoded payload to `req.user`.
On missing or invalid token, respond with `401 { error: "Unauthorized" }`.
Import path: `import { verifyToken } from '../utils/jwt'`.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Valid token: attaches decoded payload to `req.user` and calls `next()`
- [ ] Missing header: responds 401 with `{ error: "Unauthorized" }`
- [ ] Invalid/expired token: responds 401 with `{ error: "Unauthorized" }`
- [ ] Tests cover all three cases
```

## What NOT to Include in Plans

- Full implementation code (code snippets for patterns are fine; complete implementations are not)
- Absolute file paths (always use paths relative to project root)
- Superpowers-specific directives or REQUIRED SUB-SKILL headers
- References to tools or skills the executing agent should use
- Tasks with fewer than 2 acceptance criteria (not specific enough)
- Tasks that touch more than 5 files (split them)
