# Initializing Review Dimensions

Project-aware dimension creator: scan tech stack, propose tailored dimensions with evidence,
let the user select, write files, and validate with the validation script.

> **CRITICAL — Inline output only.** Always produce dimension proposals, evidence citations,
> and trigger patterns directly in your current response. Never write "the simulated output is
> complete above", "see my previous response", or any similar deferral. If no files can be
> written (simulation context), still emit the full proposed dimension YAML/Markdown inline.

Supporting references (dimension format spec, 5 example dimensions) are in
`review-sdlc/REFERENCE.md` and `review-sdlc/EXAMPLES.md`. Locate them using Glob
with `path: ~/.claude` and pattern `**/review-sdlc/REFERENCE.md`. If not found, retry
Glob with the default path (cwd). Use the same approach for EXAMPLES.md.

---

## Arguments

- `--add` — expansion mode: propose only dimensions not already installed
- `--no-copilot` — skip the GitHub Copilot instructions prompt after dimension creation

---

## Plan Mode Check

If the system context contains "Plan mode is active":

1. Announce: "This skill requires write operations. Exit plan mode first, then re-invoke `/review-init-sdlc`."
2. Stop. Do not proceed to subsequent steps.

---

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Pre-flight Checks

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
```

If not inside a git repository, stop with: `This skill must be run from inside a git repository.`

### Step 1 (SCAN) — Analyze Project Tech Stack

Use Glob to discover and then Read in parallel to collect signals. Do NOT read entire
codebases — read only manifests, config files, and directory listings.

**Dependency manifests (read if they exist):**

- `package.json` — Node.js/JS/TS deps, devDeps, scripts
- `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py` — Python
- `go.mod` — Go
- `Cargo.toml` — Rust
- `pom.xml`, `build.gradle` — Java/JVM
- `Gemfile` — Ruby

**Structural signals:** Read `./scan-patterns.md` for glob patterns. Run each pattern and record hits.

**Config files (read if they exist):**

- `.github/workflows/*.yml` → CI/CD
- `.eslintrc*`, `pylintrc`, `golangci.yml` → linting
- `tsconfig.json` → check `strict` mode (type-safety dimension evidence)
- `lerna.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `nx.json` → monorepo evidence
- `*.graphql`, `openapi.yaml`, `openapi.json` → API contract evidence

**Spec framework signals:**

- `openspec/config.yaml` → OpenSpec spec-driven development; propose `spec-compliance-review` dimension

From the scan, extract: primary language(s)/framework(s), key dependency categories, directory patterns with file counts, and infrastructure/tooling signals.

---

### Step 2 — Discover Existing Dimensions

Check `.claude/review-dimensions/` for already-installed dimension files.

In `--add` (expansion) mode:

- Locate the validation script:
  ```bash
  SCRIPT=$(find ~/.claude/plugins -name "validate-dimensions.js" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  [ -z "$SCRIPT" ] && [ -f "plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/validate-dimensions.js" ] && SCRIPT="plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/validate-dimensions.js"
  ```
- Run: `node "$SCRIPT" --project-root . --json`
- Extract installed dimension names and their trigger patterns (new proposals must avoid identical globs).

Also check for uncovered file suggestions from a recent review run:

```bash
PREP=$(find ~/.claude/plugins -name "review-prepare.js" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$PREP" ] && [ -f "plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/review-prepare.js" ] && PREP="plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/review-prepare.js"
[ -n "$PREP" ] && node "$PREP" --project-root . --json 2>/dev/null
```

If this succeeds, parse `plan_critique.uncovered_suggestions` and use as additional evidence in Step 3 (cite: "Recent review found N uncovered files matching this pattern"). If the command fails, silently skip.

If NOT in expansion mode: skip this step.

---

### Step 3 (PLAN) — Propose Dimension Catalog

Read `./dimension-catalog.md` for dimension definitions. Propose dimensions matching detected evidence from Core, Extended, and Project-type sections.

**Rules:**

- Only propose a dimension if there is concrete evidence
- Always include `code-quality-review` as the baseline
- In `--add` mode: exclude installed dimensions; cite uncovered file suggestions as evidence
- Distinguish `api-review` (route/controller code quality) from `api-contract-review` (schema file changes); flag if both are proposed
- Distinguish `documentation-review` (docs presence/structure) from `documentation-quality-review` (docs content accuracy); flag if both are proposed
- When `openspec/config.yaml` is detected, propose `spec-compliance-review` (high severity) — this dimension verifies that code changes satisfy the delta spec requirements from the active OpenSpec change. The dimension body should reference `openspec/changes/*/specs/` as the authoritative requirements source and include checklist items for: every ADDED requirement has corresponding implementation, every MODIFIED requirement's changes are reflected in code, no REMOVED requirements still have active code paths.

For each proposed dimension, prepare: name (lowercase-hyphenated), description (one sentence, max 256 chars), why relevant (cite specific evidence), trigger patterns (match actual directory names), skip-when patterns, and a tailored body checklist.

**Customization is mandatory** — reference the project's actual stack in the body (e.g., "Check SQLAlchemy ORM usage — avoid raw `session.execute()` with string concatenation", not just "avoid raw SQL").

---

### Step 4 (CRITIQUE) — Evaluate Proposals

| Gate | Check |
|---|---|
| Trigger specificity | Any trigger matching `**/*` or broader? Tighten to actual directories found. |
| Overlap | Two proposed dimensions share identical trigger file sets? Flag for merging. |
| Evidence quality | Each proposal backed by concrete scan findings? Remove any without evidence. |
| Instructions tailored | Each body references project's specific framework by name? Add context if not. |
| Expansion gaps (`--add`) | Project patterns not covered by existing OR proposed dimensions? |
| Uncovered coverage (`--add`) | All `uncovered_suggestions` from Step 2 now covered? List any that remain. |
| Trigger validity | Patterns conform to glob syntax (no `***`, balanced brackets)? |
| Dimension distinction | If both `api-review`+`api-contract-review` or both doc variants proposed, confirm both are justified. |

---

### Step 5 (IMPROVE) — Refine Proposals

Based on the critique: tighten broad triggers, resolve overlaps (merge or split for exclusive coverage), add project-specific framework names to each body, remove dimensions without concrete evidence.

---

### Step 6 (DO) — Present and Create

**Present proposals** as a numbered list with evidence summaries:

```text
Proposed review dimensions for this project:

1. code-quality-review (medium severity) — always included
   Coverage: **/*.ts, **/*.tsx
   Why: TypeScript project with 47 source files

2. security-review (high severity)
   Coverage: **/middleware/**, **/auth/**, **/*auth*
   Why: Found `jsonwebtoken` and `passport` in package.json; src/auth/ with 8 files
```

Use AskUserQuestion to ask: "Install which dimensions?" Options: **all** / **select** (comma-separated numbers) / **cancel**.

For each selected dimension:

1. `mkdir -p .claude/review-dimensions`
2. Write the full dimension file (frontmatter + tailored body). Use the corresponding example from `review-sdlc/EXAMPLES.md` as the starting template, then customize with project-specific evidence.
3. Confirm each file written with its path.

---

### Step 7 — Validate Installation

Run the validation script (use `SCRIPT` resolved in Step 2, or re-resolve if Step 2 was skipped):

```bash
SCRIPT=$(find ~/.claude/plugins -name "validate-dimensions.js" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$SCRIPT" ] && [ -f "plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/validate-dimensions.js" ] && SCRIPT="plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/validate-dimensions.js"
node "$SCRIPT" --project-root . --markdown
EXIT_CODE=$?
```

- Exit code **1**: Show validation errors. Use AskUserQuestion: "Fix these validation errors automatically? (yes / no)"
- Exit code **2**: Show `Script error — see output above` and stop. Invoke error-report-sdlc — Glob `**/error-report-sdlc/REFERENCE.md`, follow with skill=review-init-sdlc, step=Step 7 — Validate Installation, error=stderr.

Present the markdown output table. If any file has errors, show the error detail and offer to fix them automatically.

---

### Step 8 (COPILOT) — Propose GitHub Copilot Review Instructions

**Skip this step if:** Step 7 reported any errors, or `--no-copilot` was passed.

Use AskUserQuestion: "Generate GitHub Copilot review instructions? Files will be created in .github/instructions/ (~1-2 KB each)." Options: **yes** / **no**.

If **no**, skip to Quality Gates.

**Check existing state:** Glob `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`. If files exist with the same names as selected dimensions, confirm overwrite. In `--add` mode: only generate for newly added dimensions.

**PLAN — map dimensions to files:** Show the proposed `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md` list with `applyTo` and estimated char count. Use AskUserQuestion: "Generate these Copilot instruction files?" Options: **yes** / **no** / **select** (numbers).

**CRITIQUE — before writing:**

| Check | Rule |
|---|---|
| Broad `applyTo` | Flag any pattern that is `**/*` or `**` alone for tightening. |
| 4,000-char overflow | Estimate char count; flag any that exceed the limit. |
| Duplicate `applyTo` | Note overlapping patterns across files (acceptable but worth flagging). |

**IMPROVE — before writing:** Condense instructions exceeding 4,000 chars (remove verbose prose, keep checklist and severity table; if still over, truncate and add `<!-- truncated to fit 4,000-char Copilot limit -->`). Tighten broad `applyTo` patterns.

**DO — write files:**

1. `mkdir -p .github/instructions`
2. Write `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md` using this template:

   ```markdown
   ---
   applyTo: "{triggers array joined by comma}"
   ---
   # {name} — Review Instructions

   {description}

   Default severity: {severity}

   ## Checklist

   {body checklist items — convert "- [ ] " prefix to "- " (plain list, no checkboxes)}

   ## Severity Guide

   {severity guide table from body, if present}
   {if skip-when patterns exist:}

   ## Note

   In Claude Code reviews, files matching these patterns are excluded: {skip-when patterns}.
   Copilot path-specific instructions do not support exclusion patterns — use judgment
   when findings apply to these files.
   ```

   | Dimension field | Copilot field | Transformation |
   |---|---|---|
   | `triggers` (array) | `applyTo` (string) | Join with `,` |
   | `description` | Opening paragraph | Used as-is |
   | `severity` | Header note | "Default severity: {value}" |
   | Body checklist | Checklist section | Strip `- [ ]` → `- ` |
   | `skip-when` | Note section | Advisory text |
   | `max-files`, `requires-full-diff` | — | Omit |

3. Confirm each file with its path and character count. Print a final summary listing all generated files with sizes.

---

## Quality Gates

- Every proposed dimension cites specific project evidence (file paths, dependency names, counts)
- Every created dimension passes all D1-D12 validation checks
- No duplicate dimension names (including against existing dimensions in `--add` mode)
- All trigger patterns reference the project's actual directory structure, not generic defaults

---

## Error Recovery

| Error Type | Example | Invoke error-report-sdlc? | Recovery Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| User error — missing tools | `gh` not authenticated, `node` not on PATH | No | Tell user clearly. Provide the command to fix it. |
| User error — wrong flags | `--add` with no dimension name | No | Show correct usage. Ask user to re-invoke. |
| Transient — MCP timeout | Atlassian MCP network failure | No | Retry once; if fails again, skip MCP signal. |
| Stale cache | Dimension metadata out of sync | No | Re-run scan from scratch (Step 1). |
| Script crash — exit 2 | validate-dimensions.js uncaught exception | Yes | Invoke `error-report-sdlc` with full context. |
| Script error — exit 1 | Invalid dimension file format | No | Show validation errors; let user correct manually. |
| MCP tool unavailable | Atlassian MCP not configured | No | Warn; continue scan with remaining signals. |

---

## Gotchas

- **Dimension file naming collision.** In `--add` mode, the skill derives a filename from the dimension name. If a file with that name already exists, it will be silently overwritten. Always check before writing.
- **Glob pattern count explosion.** Step 1 runs ~35 glob patterns. On large monorepos this can produce thousands of matches — if Glob returns >500 paths, sample the first 20.
- **Copilot step gated on gh auth.** Check `gh auth status` at the start of Step 8; skip gracefully if unauthenticated rather than failing mid-workflow.
- **validate-dimensions.js YAML parser limitations.** The script uses a hand-rolled parser for simple key-value frontmatter only. Multi-line or nested YAML produces a misleading "malformed frontmatter" error. Use flat key-value frontmatter only.
- **review-prepare.js not available at init time.** If not found via standard resolution in `--add` mode, skip the dimension matching step and proceed with manual scan.

---

## DO NOT

- Do NOT create dimension files without first running the tech stack scan (Step 1)
- Do NOT skip the validate-dimensions.js step — invalid dimensions cause review-sdlc to fail silently
- Do NOT overwrite existing dimension files without explicit user consent
- Do NOT propose more than 10 dimensions at once — offer expansion in follow-up runs with `--add`
- Do NOT invoke `error-report-sdlc` for user errors — only for script crashes (exit 2)

---

## Learning Capture

Log to `.claude/learnings/log.md` when:

- A tech stack pattern mapped to an accepted dimension — note the evidence-to-dimension mapping
- User rejected a proposed dimension — note which and likely reason
- User requested a dimension that was not proposed — note what evidence was missed
- A created dimension failed validation — note which check failed and root cause
- User opted in/out of Copilot instructions — note outcome and any condensing needed
- A Copilot instruction exceeded 4,000 chars — note which dimension and how it was condensed

## What's Next

After setting up review dimensions, common follow-ups include:
- `/review-sdlc` — run a code review with the new dimensions
- `/commit-sdlc` — commit the dimension files
