# resolve-script.sh — canonical find-then-fallback resolver for sibling plugin scripts.
# Usage: resolve_script <script-name> <path-pattern> <local-fallback>
# Echoes the resolved absolute path, or empty string on failure.
#
# Source this file once at the start of a SKILL.md bash block, then call
# resolve_script for each script you need to locate.
#
# Example:
#   RESOLVER=$(find ~/.claude/plugins -name "resolve-script.sh" -path "*/sdlc*/scripts/lib/resolve-script.sh" 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -1)
#   [ -z "$RESOLVER" ] && [ -f "plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/lib/resolve-script.sh" ] && RESOLVER="plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/lib/resolve-script.sh"
#   [ -n "$RESOLVER" ] && . "$RESOLVER"
#   SCRIPT=$(resolve_script "harden-prepare.js" "*/sdlc*/scripts/skill/harden-prepare.js" "plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/skill/harden-prepare.js")
