/**
 * Output protocols
 * ----------------
 * This module hosts two complementary output protocols. Pick the one that
 * matches the consumer:
 *
 *   - `writeOutput(data, prefix)` — LLM-skill manifest protocol. Writes JSON
 *     to a randomized temp file under `os.tmpdir()` and prints ONLY the
 *     file path on stdout, then exits. Used by prepare-scripts whose output
 *     is read back by a SKILL.md prompt via `--output-file`.
 *
 *   - `writeJsonLine(obj)` / `emitText(s)` — streaming/polling protocol.
 *     Writes a single JSON line (or raw text) directly to stdout, then
 *     exits. Used by polling/CLI consumers that want to stream verdicts or
 *     a small textual payload (await-remote-review, verify-pipeline, etc.).
 *
 * Both protocols coexist intentionally: the LLM-manifest path needs a
 * stable file path so the SKILL.md can re-read large structured payloads
 * without cluttering stdout, while streaming consumers cannot afford the
 * tmpfile detour and need stdout to be the channel.

 * removed (issue #209) because shell redirects of that fallback could
 * materialize transient `*-context-*.json` artifacts in the consumer cwd.
 * Callers that previously relied on stdout JSON must read the printed path.
