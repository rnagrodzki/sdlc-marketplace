/**
 * plan-handoff-advisory.js
 * Thin wrapper around `lib/context-advisory.getAdvisory()` for plan-sdlc
 * Step 7. Exists as a dedicated script so the skill can invoke it via Bash
 * with a stable relative path — invoking via `node -e` would require the
 * skill to know the absolute lib path at every cwd it might run from.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - When the sidecar at $TMPDIR/sdlc-context-stats.json indicates
 *     `heavy: true`, prints the advisory text to stdout (suitable for
 *     prepending to the handoff menu).
 *   - When the sidecar is absent, malformed, or `heavy: false`, prints
 *     nothing.
 *   - Always exits 0. Any internal error is swallowed so plan-sdlc Step 7
 *     never blocks on this advisory.
