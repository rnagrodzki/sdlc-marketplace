/**
 * stop-pipeline-continue.js
 * Stop hook (no matcher) — implements R68 (issue #452, broadened) and
 * R-stop-inprogress-mode-independent (issue #454, recurrence of #452).
 *
 * Returns `decision: "block"` with a factual `reason` when the following hold,
 * with the `flags.auto` gate applied ASYMMETRICALLY by step status:
 *   (a) a ship state file exists for the current branch,
 *   (b) `pipelineAdvancing(data).advancing === true` (R-advancing-predicate,
 *       lib/state.js — covers both an `in_progress` step AND the between-steps
 *       `pending` gap, incl. the R38 failed+terminal-`cleanup` case),
 *   (c) the `flags.auto` gate:
 *         - `in_progress` step → block REGARDLESS of `flags.auto` (#454: a mid-step
 *           gap is never a valid pause; the Stop hook is the only enforcement layer
 *           that can prevent turn-end before the next Agent dispatch),
 *         - between-steps `pending` → block ONLY when `flags.auto === true`
 *           (non-auto interactive review between steps is a legitimate pause), AND
 *   (d) `stop_hook_active !== true` on stdin, AND
 *   (e) the invoking session owns the pipeline (R73, #505 —
 *       `hookEnforcementAllowed(data, payload)` matches `payload.session_id`
 *       against `data.sessionId`). R73 GATES the rules above; it does not
 *       replace them — the mode-independent `in_progress` block and the
 *       `stop_hook_active` early-exit are preserved unchanged.
 *
 * In every other condition (no state file, advancing false, between-steps pending
 * with non-auto, stop_hook_active === true, foreign session) the hook exits 0
 * silently with no stdout.
 *
 * The asymmetry mirrors hooks/pipeline-continue.js (in_progress mode-independent;
 * pending auto-gated — no-opposite-logical-vectors). The `stop_hook_active === true`
 * early-exit avoids contributing to the Claude Code 8-consecutive-continuation cap
 * (and prevents the now-mode-independent in_progress block from looping against that
 * cap in non-auto mode). The hook never mutates the ship state file, so its block
 * decision is a pure function of pipeline state — but an unchanged advancing step
 * would otherwise block forever, so a consecutive-block counter (STOP_BLOCK_CAP,
 * keyed by step name) is kept in its own sidecar file, never in the ship state
 * file itself, so the hook stays non-mutating with respect to pipeline state.
 * After STOP_BLOCK_CAP consecutive blocks on the same unchanged step, the hook
 * degrades to silent exit 0 (with a stderr note) rather than blocking forever.
 * The counter resets whenever the current step name differs from the one recorded
 * in the sidecar, so ordinary multi-step progress is unaffected.
 *
 * Lazy-loads ../scripts/lib/state.js and ../scripts/lib/git.js. Requires only
 * Node.js built-ins plus those two lib files — no new npm dependencies.
 *
 * Exit codes:
 *   0 = always (graceful degradation — emits a block decision only when all four
 *       conditions hold; otherwise exits 0 silently).
