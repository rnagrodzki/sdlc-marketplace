# Review-sdlc — post-confirmation context (reply: cancel)

The `review-orchestrator` agent has already completed. It persisted the consolidated
comment body to the path shown below and returned the following summary to the skill's
main context. No further orchestrator dispatch should happen.

`/tmp/review-diff-def456/review-comment.md` exists with the formatted comment body.
`.claude/reviews/` does not yet contain any entry for this branch.

## User interaction

The skill displayed the summary and the formatted comment, then showed the prompt:

```text
Post this review comment to PR #42? (yes / save / cancel)
```

The user replied: **cancel**

Describe precisely what the skill does. It must NOT call `gh api`, must NOT write any
file under `.claude/reviews/`, and must still clean up both the manifest file and the
diff dir at `/tmp/review-diff-def456`.
