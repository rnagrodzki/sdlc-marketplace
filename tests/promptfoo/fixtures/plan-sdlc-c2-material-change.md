# Plan Material Change Re-dispatch (R64)

This fixture exercises the Step 6 material-change detector and the Step 5 merged re-dispatch it
triggers: when Step 6 IMPROVE adds (or removes) a task, the NEXT Step 5 iteration must dispatch
the Step 3 lanes AND the Step 5 lens reviewers together, in a single message, as one combined
review-loop iteration.

## Plan under review: "Catalog price-sync" (5 tasks after Step 6 fixes)

## Step 5 iteration 1 result (before Step 6)

Status: **Issues Found**. Both the `requirements` and `risk` lens reviewers flagged that the plan
does not cover validating the incoming price-sync payload before it reaches the catalog writer —
no task addresses malformed/partial vendor payloads.

`taskCountBefore` (snapshotted at the start of Step 6) = **4**.

## Step 6 IMPROVE — fixes applied

To resolve the lens findings, the plan author:
- Adds a brand-new **Task 5: "Validate incoming price-sync payload"** (`src/sync/validate-payload.ts`,
  `tests/sync/validate-payload.test.ts`) — this did not exist before.
- Adds a `## Deviations & assumptions` row: `payload validation | (not specified) | rejects
  malformed vendor payloads before write | implied by lens finding on data integrity`.
- Leaves Tasks 1–4 and their `**Files:**` blocks otherwise unchanged.

`taskCountAfter` (recomputed after the rewrite) = **5**.

## Material change detection outcome

`taskCountAfter !== taskCountBefore` (5 ≠ 4) → the task-count-delta trigger fires →
`materialChangeDetected = true`.

## What must happen on the NEXT Step 5 iteration (iteration 2)

Per R64, because `materialChangeDetected` is true, iteration 2 must dispatch, in a single message,
as parallel Agent tool calls with `run_in_background: false` on each:
- all 5 entries of `lanes[]` (static-structural, content-coverage, file-existence,
  guardrail-compliance, dimension-coverage) — the SAME lanes Step 3 uses, re-run against the
  updated 5-task plan
- all 3 entries of `lensReviewers[]` (architecture, requirements, risk)

This is 8 total dispatched agents, awaited as one barrier (N = 5 lanes + 3 lenses = 8) before any
consolidation. This merged fan-out counts as exactly ONE iteration of the Step 5 review loop (the
counter goes from 1 to 2, not to 3), and `materialChangeDetected` is cleared back to `false` once
the merged issue set is assembled.
