# R73 (#505) NEGATIVE-TERM guard — this is the reported stall. The state's
# `worktree` field records the MAIN checkout (written unexpanded below), while
# the hook is invoked with a payload `cwd` pointing at a linked task worktree.
# The gate carries NO worktree term by design: `worktree` is diagnostic-only and
# legitimately mismatches for a step dispatched with isolation: "worktree", and
# resolveStateDir() already routes through the main worktree so merely locating
# the file proves same-repo. The hooks must still enforce.
# NOTE: unquoted heredoc — $PWD expands to this fixture's temp-copied checkout.
