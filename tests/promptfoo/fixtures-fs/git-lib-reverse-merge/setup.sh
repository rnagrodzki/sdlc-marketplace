# Fixture for git-lib-exec.yaml — issue #364 reverse-merge test.
# Builds a repo where `main` advanced after the feature branch forked, so that
# two-dot (`main..HEAD`) reports zero base-only files but three-dot (`main...HEAD`)
# correctly limits the diff to branch-contributed files only.
#
# History after setup (HEAD = feature):
#
#   * (main)    add base-only.js          <- after fork
#   |
#   | * (HEAD, feature) add feature.js
#   |/
#   * init seed.txt                       <- merge-base
#
# Expected behavior:
#   getChangedFiles('main', repo, 'all')       -> ['feature.js']           (three-dot, post-fix)
#   getChangedFiles('main', repo, 'committed') -> ['feature.js']           (three-dot, baseline)
#   Pre-fix 'all' would emit `git diff --cached --name-only main`, which is
#   wrong-direction (compares index to main) and leaks `base-only.js` because
#   it is present on `main` but not in feature's index.
