# Change: my-change

## Why
Test fixture for detectActiveChanges diff-fallback branch matching and
syncIncompleteTasks.

## What Changes
- Add a diff-fallback branch-matching test fixture.

# Feature branch name deliberately does NOT match the change slug "my-change" —
# forces detectActiveChanges past the branch-slug match and into the
# committed-diff fallback (git diff --name-only main...HEAD).
git checkout -q -b feat/issue-42-rework

mkdir -p openspec/changes/my-change/specs

# Delta Spec: my-change

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Diff fallback matching
The system SHALL resolve branchMatch via the committed-diff fallback when the
current branch name does not match any active change slug.

#### Scenario: mismatched branch name
- WHEN the current branch name does not match any active change slug
- THEN detectActiveChanges resolves branchMatch via the single-change diff heuristic
