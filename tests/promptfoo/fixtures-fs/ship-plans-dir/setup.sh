# A configured plansDirectory (R72/C19, #505): before the fix, ship.js scanned
# this directory for the most recently modified *.md file and used it as
# context.planFile. That scan is shared across every repo on the machine, so
# it could hand this repo a plan written for a different one.

# Plan: Unrelated Repository Feature

This plan document does not belong to this repository. If ship.js ever
resolves context.planFile by scanning a configured plansDirectory instead of
requiring an explicit --plan flag, this decoy would be wrongly selected and
implemented here (issue #505).
