## Troubleshooting

### "Plugin not found" when updating via `/plugin` UI

Clear the cache, restart, and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/sdlc-marketplace
```

Then restart Claude Code and run:

```text
/plugin install sdlc@sdlc-marketplace
```

### Plugin not updating after marketplace refresh

The `version` field in `plugin.json` must be bumped for Claude Code to detect a new version. If the version hasn't changed, Claude Code uses the cached copy.

### Auto-update not working

Open `/plugin`, go to the **Marketplaces** tab, and verify auto-update is toggled on for `sdlc-marketplace`. Auto-update is off by default for third-party marketplaces.

### Timeout during marketplace add or plugin install

Large repositories may exceed the default git timeout. Set the environment variable before starting Claude Code:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_GIT_TIMEOUT_MS=300000
```
