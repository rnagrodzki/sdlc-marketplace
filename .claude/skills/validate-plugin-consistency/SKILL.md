# Validate Plugin Consistency

After modifying the `sdlc-utilities` plugin, run this validation to catch structural
issues that would cause failures in users' repositories.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when you have modified any of:

- `plugins/sdlc-utilities/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/*.js`

## Step 1 — Run the Validation Script

```bash
node .claude/skills/validate-plugin-consistency/check-consistency.js
```

If the script exits 0: all checks pass — proceed.

If the script exits 1: fix each issue before finishing the task (see Step 2).

If the script exits 2: run from the repository root or pass `--project-root <path>`.

## Step 2 — Fix Issues Found

For each finding, apply the appropriate fix:

### `script-resolution-order` (error)

The `find` pattern searches CWD (`.`) before `~/.claude/plugins`. Reverse the order:

```bash
# Correct (plugins-first)
SCRIPT=$(find ~/.claude/plugins -name "<script>.js" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$SCRIPT" ] && [ -f "plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/<script>.js" ] && SCRIPT="plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/<script>.js"
[ -z "$SCRIPT" ] && { echo "ERROR: Could not locate <script>.js. Is the sdlc plugin installed?" >&2; exit 2; }
```

### `skill-runs-script` (error)

A skill is paired with a prepare script but does not contain the find+node resolution
pattern. Skills must run their own prepare scripts. Add the find+mktemp+node block to
the skill following the pattern in `review-sdlc/SKILL.md`:

1. Skill: find script → mktemp → `node "$SCRIPT" $ARGUMENTS --json > "$FILE"` → read and parse JSON

### `skill-uses-mktemp` (error)

A skill runs a prepare script but pipes output directly instead of using a temp file.
Replace with:

```bash
MANIFEST_FILE=$(mktemp /tmp/<name>-XXXXXX.json)
node "$SCRIPT" $ARGUMENTS --json > "$MANIFEST_FILE"
EXIT_CODE=$?
```

### `skill-checks-exit-code` (error)

A skill runs a script but doesn't capture `EXIT_CODE`. Add after the node call:

```bash
EXIT_CODE=$?
# Exit code 1: show the stderr message to the user and stop.
# Exit code 2: show "Script error — see output above" and stop.
```

### `skill-passes-arguments` (warning)

A skill runs a prepare script but doesn't use `$ARGUMENTS`. Change the node
invocation to: `node "$SCRIPT" $ARGUMENTS --json > "$MANIFEST_FILE"`

### `frontmatter-field-names` (error)

A skill uses the deprecated `user-invokable` field. Replace with `user-invocable`.

### `user-invocable-flag` (error)

A user-facing skill is missing `user-invocable: true` in its frontmatter. Add it:

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>
description: "..."
user-invocable: true
---
```

The 11 user-facing skills that must have this flag are: `plan-sdlc`, `execute-plan-sdlc`,
`pr-sdlc`, `pr-customize-sdlc`, `review-sdlc`, `review-init-sdlc`, `received-review-sdlc`,
`commit-sdlc`, `version-sdlc`, `jira-sdlc`, `ship-sdlc`.

### `docs-skill-existence` (error)

A skill directory exists under `plugins/sdlc-utilities/skills/<name>/` but has no matching
documentation file at `docs/skills/<name>.md`. Create the doc file using `docs/skill-doc-template.md`
as the starting point.

### `skills-meta-existence` (error)

A user-invocable skill has no matching `slug` entry in `site/src/data/skills-meta.ts`. Add an
entry to the `skillsMeta` array with the correct slug, command, category, tagline, pipeline,
and connections. See existing entries for the format.

### `readme-skills-table` (warning)

A user-invocable skill is not listed in the README.md skills table. Add a row following the
format: `| [\`/<name>\`](docs/skills/<name>.md) | description |`

### `temp-file-cleanup` (warning)

A skill uses `mktemp` to create a temp file but has no cleanup reference (`rm -f`, `rm -rf`,
or "clean" in narrative). Add cleanup instructions to the skill, ensuring temp files are removed
on all exit paths (success, error, cancellation).

## Step 3 — Re-run Validation

After fixing all issues:

```bash
node .claude/skills/validate-plugin-consistency/check-consistency.js
```

Confirm exit 0 before marking work complete.

## Reference: The Correct Skill Pattern (for paired skills)

Every skill that has a matching `*-prepare.js` script must follow this exact pattern:

```bash
# Step 0: Resolve and run the prepare script
SCRIPT=$(find ~/.claude/plugins -name "<name>-prepare.js" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$SCRIPT" ] && [ -f "plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/<name>-prepare.js" ] && SCRIPT="plugins/sdlc-utilities/scripts/<name>-prepare.js"
[ -z "$SCRIPT" ] && { echo "ERROR: Could not locate <name>-prepare.js. Is the sdlc plugin installed?" >&2; exit 2; }

CONTEXT_FILE=$(mktemp /tmp/<name>-context-XXXXXX.json)
node "$SCRIPT" $ARGUMENTS --json > "$CONTEXT_FILE"
EXIT_CODE=$?
# Cleanup: rm -f "$CONTEXT_FILE" after use

# On non-zero EXIT_CODE:
# Exit code 1: show stderr message to the user and stop.
# Exit code 2: show "Script error — see output above" and stop.

# Step 1: Read and parse CONTEXT_FILE as CONTEXT_JSON, then proceed with skill logic.
```
