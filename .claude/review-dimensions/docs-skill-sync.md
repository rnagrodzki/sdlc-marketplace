# Documentation–Skill Sync Review

Review that every skill definition change is propagated to all three downstream documentation surfaces: the `docs/skills/` reference doc, the `site/src/data/skills-meta.ts` site metadata, and the `README.md` skills table. This project uses an Astro site (`site/`) that reads skill docs via a content collection loader (`site/src/content.config.ts` → `../docs/skills`), and renders pipeline diagrams and SkillCard tiles from `skills-meta.ts`.

## Checklist

### 1:1 existence checks
- [ ] Every skill directory under `plugins/sdlc-utilities/skills/<name>/` has a matching `docs/skills/<name>.md`
- [ ] Every user-invocable skill has a row in the `README.md` Skills table (non-user-invocable skills like `error-report-sdlc` still need a doc but not a README row)
- [ ] Every user-invocable skill has an entry in `site/src/data/skills-meta.ts` `skillsMeta` array with matching `slug`

### Content consistency — docs/skills/*.md
- [ ] The doc's Overview matches the skill's actual purpose — if the SKILL.md workflow changed, the doc Overview must reflect the new behavior
- [ ] The doc's Flags table lists every flag the SKILL.md documents (and no removed flags)
- [ ] The doc's Prerequisites list matches the SKILL.md's actual tool/config requirements
- [ ] The doc's "What It Creates or Modifies" section reflects the current artifacts the skill produces
- [ ] The doc's Related Skills section references correct skill names and paths
- [ ] The doc follows the template structure from `docs/skill-doc-template.md`

### Content consistency — site/src/data/skills-meta.ts
- [ ] The `tagline` field accurately summarizes the skill's current behavior — stale taglines that describe old workflows are high-severity
- [ ] The `pipeline` array reflects the SKILL.md's current workflow steps in order — added/removed/renamed steps must be updated
- [ ] The `connections` array reflects the skill's actual See Also / Related Skills — broken or missing connections produce dead links on the site
- [ ] The `category` field is correct for the skill's current function (planning, review, gitops, integrations)
- [ ] The `userInvocable` field matches the skill's frontmatter `user-invocable` value

### Content consistency — README.md
- [ ] The skill description in the README table matches the skill's actual purpose (doesn't need to be identical to tagline, but must be accurate)
- [ ] The README table link points to the correct `docs/skills/<name>.md` path

### Template and structural changes
- [ ] If `docs/skill-doc-template.md` changed, check whether existing skill docs need to adopt the new structure
- [ ] If `site/src/content.config.ts` changed (e.g., loader base path), verify that docs are still being picked up correctly

## Severity Guide

| Finding | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| Skill exists but has no docs/skills/ doc file | critical |
| SKILL.md workflow changed but pipeline array in skills-meta.ts is stale | high |
| Flags added/removed in SKILL.md but doc Flags table not updated | high |
| Tagline in skills-meta.ts describes old behavior | high |
| Broken connection in skills-meta.ts (references non-existent slug) | high |
| Missing README table row for user-invocable skill | medium |
| README description materially inaccurate | medium |
| Related Skills section references wrong skill name | medium |
| Doc Prerequisites list doesn't match actual requirements | medium |
| Minor wording drift between doc and skill (not materially wrong) | low |
| Template structure deviation in older doc | info |
