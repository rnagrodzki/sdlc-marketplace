# `/review-sdlc` — Multi-Dimension Code Review

## Overview

Loads project review dimensions from `.sdlc/review-dimensions/`, matches them to changed files via glob patterns, dispatches parallel review subagents for each matching dimension, deduplicates findings, and posts a consolidated comment to the PR. By default reviews committed branch changes plus staged changes. Requires at least one dimension file — run `/setup-sdlc --dimensions` first if none exist.

Branch-contribution diffs (the `committed` and `all` scopes) use git's three-dot range form (`<base>...HEAD`) so files that landed on the base branch after the feature branch diverged do not appear as findings (issue #239). Before computing the diff, the prepare script attempts a best-effort `git fetch origin <base>:<base>` to fast-forward the local base ref; failure (offline, no remote, auth denied) is non-fatal and the skill proceeds with whatever the local ref reports. The `worktree` scope is exempt by design — it intentionally compares the full working tree against the bare base.

## Usage

```text
/review-sdlc
```

---

## Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--base <branch>` | Compare against this branch instead of auto-detected base | auto-detected |
| `--committed` | Review only committed branch changes (excludes staged) | — |
| `--staged` | Review only staged changes vs HEAD | — |
| `--working` | Review all uncommitted changes vs HEAD (staged + unstaged) | — |
| `--worktree` | Review full working tree vs base: committed + staged + unstaged | — |
| `--set-default` | Save the resolved scope to `.claude/review.json` as the project default | — |
| `--dimensions <name,...>` | Run only the named dimensions (comma-separated) | all matching |
| `--dry-run` | Show the review plan without dispatching subagents | — |

> **Scope flags:** `--committed`, `--staged`, `--working`, and `--worktree` are mutually exclusive. `--staged` and `--working` cannot be combined with `--base`.

---

## Examples

### Run a full review (committed + staged changes)

```text
/review-sdlc
```

### Review staged changes before committing

```text
/review-sdlc --staged
```

### Review all local changes (staged + unstaged)

```text
/review-sdlc --working
```

### Review only committed changes (exclude staged)

```text
/review-sdlc --committed
```

### Review against a non-default base branch

```text
/review-sdlc --base develop
```

### Run specific dimensions only

```text
/review-sdlc --dimensions security-review,api-review
```

### Review full working tree including unstaged changes

```text
/review-sdlc --worktree
```

### Save a scope as the project default, then run

```text
/review-sdlc --set-default --worktree
```

Saves `worktree` to `.sdlc/review.json` and runs the review. Subsequent `/review-sdlc` calls will use `worktree` automatically.

### Preview what would be reviewed without running

```text
/review-sdlc --dry-run
```

---

## Configuration

The default scope can be persisted in `.sdlc/review.json`:

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "scope": "worktree"
  }
}
```

**Scope resolution order:** CLI flag → `.sdlc/review.json` → `all` (hardcoded default)

Use `--set-default` to create or update this file without editing it manually:

```text
/review-sdlc --set-default --staged
```

Valid scope values: `all`, `committed`, `staged`, `working`, `worktree`.

### Dimension frontmatter fields

Each `.sdlc/review-dimensions/<name>.md` declares a dimension via YAML frontmatter. The full set of supported fields:

| Field | Required | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | string | Dimension identifier (lowercase, digits, hyphens; ≤64 chars) |
| `description` | yes | string | One-line dimension purpose (≤256 chars) |
| `triggers` | yes | string[] | Glob patterns selecting files this dimension reviews |
| `severity` | no | string | Default severity bucket: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info` |
| `skip-when` | no | string[] | Glob patterns that exclude files even when `triggers` match |
| `max-files` | no | integer | Cap on files dispatched to this dimension's subagent |
| `requires-full-diff` | no | boolean | Pass full diff (not file list) to the subagent |
| `model` | no | string | Per-dimension model override; passed verbatim to the dispatched subagent (overrides `manifest.subagent_model`). Claude Code only — the Copilot transform in `setup-sdlc` omits it. |

Example with `model:` override:

```yaml
---
name: security-review
description: Identify security risks in changed code.
severity: high
model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
triggers:
  - "**/*.ts"
  - "**/*.js"
---
```

When `model:` is absent, the orchestrator falls back to `manifest.subagent_model` (default: `sonnet`).

---

### Dimension scoping best practices

Narrow `triggers` keep reviewer subagents focused on the files they are qualified to evaluate. Broad globs hand every changed file to every dimension — cost scales roughly with `dimensions × changed_files`. A 40-file PR reviewed by 5 dimensions with `triggers: ["**/*"]` sends ~200 file-reads to subagents; the same PR with each dimension scoped to its real surface sends ~40 (~5× reduction). Token savings compound on large PRs where most changed files are irrelevant to most dimensions.

#### How matching works

`scripts/skill/review.js::matchFiles` (around L176–L188) intersects the `triggers` glob list against the changed-file set, then subtracts any files matched by `skip-when`. The resulting per-dimension `matched_files` array is the only context the reviewer subagent sees — it does not receive the full diff unless `requires-full-diff: true` is set. There is no implicit fallback: an empty `triggers` list matches zero files and the dimension is reported `SKIPPED`. When a dimension matches more than 80% of changed files, the plan-critique step flags it as `over_broad_dimensions` (around `review.js:291` in `critiquePlan`) — the existing automated signal for this anti-pattern.

#### Glob → dimension examples

| `triggers` | Dimension | Why scoped this way |
|---|---|---|
| `**/*.test.{ts,js}` | `test-quality` | Assertions, isolation, coverage — only meaningful on test files |
| `scripts/**` | `script-conventions` | Exit codes, error handling, Node patterns — irrelevant for app code |
| `**/*.{yaml,yml}` | `config-schema` | Required fields, type correctness, env references |
| `plugins/**/SKILL.md` | `skill-authoring` | Skill format, required sections — only valid on SKILL.md files |

Use `skip-when` to carve out sub-paths you do not want reviewed by a broad trigger:

```yaml
triggers:
  - "src/**/*.ts"
skip-when:
  - "**/*.test.ts"
  - "**/__generated__/**"
```

This sends only non-test, non-generated TypeScript files to the dimension — a meaningful reduction on projects that co-locate tests and source.

#### Anti-pattern: the catch-all dimension

Do not author a "general code review" dimension with `triggers: ["**/*"]` and no `skip-when`. Every changed file — config, docs, generated code, test fixtures — is dispatched to that subagent on every review. The cost is `files × dimensions`; the signal is low because the reviewer wastes attention on files unrelated to its stated purpose. The `plan_critique.over_broad_dimensions` warning is the automated detection for this pattern.

#### Migrating from a broad dimension

1. Run `/review-sdlc --dry-run` on a recent PR and inspect which files the broad dimension matched. Look for natural clusters (auth code, migration files, config, tests).
2. Author one focused dimension per cluster with explicit `triggers`, adding `skip-when` to exclude tests or generated artifacts where appropriate.

Avoid relying on `max-files` truncation as a substitute for scoping — truncation silently drops the tail of the match list, so some files are never reviewed rather than being reviewed by a qualified dimension.

For canonical `triggers:` blocks and complete dimension examples, see [`EXAMPLES.md`](../../plugins/sdlc-utilities/skills/review-sdlc/EXAMPLES.md).

## Consolidated Comment Format

The command posts a single PR comment:

```markdown
## Code Review — 3 dimension(s), 7 finding(s)

> Automated review by `review-sdlc` v0.20.7 · 2026-02-25

### Summary

| Dimension       | Findings | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |
|-----------------|----------|----------|------|--------|-----|------|
| security-review | 3        | 0        | 2    | 1      | 0   | 0    |
| code-quality    | 4        | 0        | 0    | 2      | 2   | 0    |
| **Total**       | **7**    | **0**    | **2**| **3**  | **2**| **0**|

### Verdict: APPROVED WITH NOTES

Two high-severity security findings require attention before merging.

---

### security-review — 3 finding(s)

<details>
<summary>0 critical · 2 high · 1 medium · 0 low · 0 info</summary>

#### [HIGH] Unvalidated user input passed to exec()
**File:** `src/handlers/deploy.ts:47`
User-supplied `command` parameter is passed directly to `child_process.exec()` without sanitization.
**Suggestion:** Use `execFile()` with a fixed command and pass arguments as an array.

</details>
```

The attribution line includes the sdlc-utilities plugin version (e.g., `v0.20.7`) so reviewers can correlate findings with the skill version that produced them. The version is resolved by the prepare script and embedded in the comment footer — it does not change between runs of the same plugin version.

---

## OWASP Top 10 metadata

Findings produced by an OWASP-aware dimension carry an optional `**OWASP:**` field (`A01`–`A10`) that names the matching category. The field is opt-in per dimension — only dimensions whose body explicitly instructs OWASP tagging populate it (the bundled `security-review` example does, see [`EXAMPLES.md`](../../plugins/sdlc-utilities/skills/review-sdlc/EXAMPLES.md#security-reviewmd)). Other dimensions omit the field and their findings render unchanged.

When the field is present, it renders in the consolidated comment as a suffix on the file line:

```markdown
#### [CRITICAL] SQL injection via string concatenation
**File:** `src/users/search.ts:34` · OWASP A03
User-supplied `q` is concatenated into a SQL string before execution.
**Suggestion:** Use parameterised queries via the existing `db.prepared(...)` helper.
```

Default severities follow OWASP impact: `critical` for A01/A02/A03/A07, `high` for A04/A05/A06/A08/A10, `medium` for A09. The `security-review` example dimension's checklist enumerates one bullet per category and instructs the subagent to tag each finding with the matching code.

---

## Dimension Suggestions

When the review finds changed files not covered by any active dimension, it analyzes their patterns and suggests new dimensions in the review plan output:

```text
Suggested new dimensions for uncovered files:

  ci-cd-pipeline-review — 2 CI/CD workflow files not covered
    Files: .github/workflows/ci.yml, .github/workflows/deploy.yml

  configuration-management-review — 3 configuration files not covered
    Files: src/config/db.ts, src/config/auth.ts, .env.example

Run `/setup-sdlc --dimensions --add` to create these dimensions.
```

Files that cannot be mapped to any known dimension type are listed separately:

```text
2 file(s) not mappable to any known dimension type:
  src/custom-runtime.xyz
  build-tool.conf
Consider creating a custom dimension or broadening existing trigger patterns.
```

These suggestions are informational during a review run. To act on them, run `/setup-sdlc --dimensions --add`.

---

## PR Posting Flow

After the orchestrator returns, the full consolidated review (all per-dimension findings, every severity, with `file:line` references and per-dimension `<details>` sections) is printed to the terminal verbatim — read directly from `${diff_dir}/review-comment.md`. The posting prompt then appears below it; replying `cancel` no longer hides any content from view because the body was already shown.

What you see next depends on whether a PR exists for the current branch and the review scope.

### When a PR exists

After printing the full comment body above, the skill prompts:

```text
Post this review comment to PR #{number}? (yes / save / cancel)
```

| Reply | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `yes` | Posts the comment to the PR via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{number}/comments -F body=@{comment_file}`. The `-F body=@<path>` form reads the body from the file, so markdown with backticks, quotes, or long content posts reliably — no shell escaping. |
| `save` | Copies the comment to `.claude/reviews/<branch>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (slashes in branch names are replaced with `-`). Does not post. |
| `cancel` | No action. The review remains visible in the terminal only. |

No additional orchestrator or dimension subagent is dispatched after your reply — the comment body was computed during the single orchestrator run and persisted to disk.

### When no PR exists — branch scope (`all` / `committed` / `worktree`)

```text
No PR found. Options:
  1. Create a draft PR and attach this review as a comment
  2. Save review to .claude/reviews/<branch>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
  3. Keep in terminal only
```

Option 1 invokes `/pr-sdlc` in draft mode, then posts the comment to the newly created PR.

### When no PR exists — local scope (`staged` / `working`)

```text
Reviewing local changes — no PR to post to. Options:
  1. Save review to .claude/reviews/<branch>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md
  2. Keep in terminal only
```

### Comment persistence

During the run, the consolidated comment body is written to `${diff_dir}/review-comment.md` (a temporary location under `$TMPDIR`). The skill reads this path from the orchestrator summary and (a) emits the file's contents verbatim in the terminal before the posting prompt, and (b) uses the same file as the body source for `gh api -F body=@…` or `save` copies. The file is discarded along with the diff dir after the terminal branch — including when you reply `cancel` or the command fails — but its contents remain visible in scrollback.

---

## Post-Review Self-Fix

After a review completes with actionable findings (verdict **CHANGES REQUESTED** or **APPROVED WITH NOTES**), the skill prompts:

```text
Would you like to address these findings? (fix / no)
  fix — process findings and implement fixes using received-review-sdlc
  no  — done
```

Choosing `fix` invokes `/received-review-sdlc`, which picks up the findings from conversation context, analyzes each finding against the full codebase context, presents a proposed action plan, and implements only after user approval. The prompt is skipped when the verdict is `APPROVED` (no findings to address).

---

## Prerequisites

- **`.sdlc/review-dimensions/`** — at least one dimension file must exist. Run `/setup-sdlc --dimensions` to create them.
- **`gh` CLI** — recommended for posting the PR comment. Falls back to terminal output if unavailable.

### Harness Configuration

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `argument-hint` | `[--base <branch>] [--committed] [--staged] [--dimensions <name,...>]` |
| Plan mode | Compatible (read-only analysis; skips PR comment posting) |

---

## What It Creates or Modifies

| File / Artifact | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| GitHub PR comment | Consolidated review findings posted to the current PR |

## Link Verification (issue #198)

Before `gh api … /comments` is invoked, the skill pipes the consolidated review-comment body through `scripts/lib/links.js` as a hard gate. The validator auto-derives `expectedRepo` from `git remote origin` and `jiraSite` from `~/.sdlc-cache/jira/` — the skill never constructs the validator context. URL classes checked: GitHub issues/PRs (owner/repo identity + existence), Atlassian `*.atlassian.net/browse/<KEY>` (host match), and any other `http(s)://` URL (HEAD reachability, 5s timeout). Hosts in the built-in skip list (`linkedin.com`, `x.com`, `twitter.com`, `medium.com`) are reported as `skipped`, not violations. Set `SDLC_LINKS_OFFLINE=1` to skip generic reachability while keeping context-aware checks. On non-zero exit, the comment is **not** posted and the violation list is surfaced verbatim. No flag toggles this gate — it is hard.
