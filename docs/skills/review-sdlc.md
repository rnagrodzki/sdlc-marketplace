# `/review-sdlc` — Multi-Dimension Code Review

## Overview

Loads project review dimensions from `.claude/review-dimensions/`, matches them to changed files via glob patterns, dispatches parallel review subagents for each matching dimension, deduplicates findings, and posts a consolidated comment to the PR. By default reviews committed branch changes plus staged changes. Requires at least one dimension file — run `/review-init-sdlc` first if none exist.

---

## Usage

```text
/review-sdlc
```

---

## Flags

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--base <branch>` | Compare against this branch instead of auto-detected base | auto-detected |
| `--committed` | Review only committed branch changes (excludes staged) | — |
| `--staged` | Review only staged changes vs HEAD | — |
| `--working` | Review all uncommitted changes vs HEAD (staged + unstaged) | — |
| `--worktree` | Review full working tree vs base: committed + staged + unstaged | — |
| `--set-default` | Save the resolved scope to `.claude/review.json` as the project default | — |
| `--dimensions <name,...>` | Run only the named dimensions (comma-separated) | all matching |
| `--dry-run` | Show the review plan without dispatching subagents | — |

> **Scope flags:** `--committed`, `--staged`, `--working`, and `--worktree` are mutually exclusive. `--staged` and `--working` cannot be combined with `--base`.

## Examples

### Run a full review (committed + staged changes)

```text
/review-sdlc
```

### Review staged changes before committing

```text
/review-sdlc --staged
```

### Review all local changes (staged + unstaged)

```text
/review-sdlc --working
```

### Review only committed changes (exclude staged)

```text
/review-sdlc --committed
```

### Review against a non-default base branch

```text
/review-sdlc --base develop
```

### Run specific dimensions only

```text
/review-sdlc --dimensions security-review,api-review
```

### Review full working tree including unstaged changes

```text
/review-sdlc --worktree
```

### Save a scope as the project default, then run

```text
/review-sdlc --set-default --worktree
```

Saves `worktree` to `.claude/review.json` and runs the review. Subsequent `/review-sdlc` calls will use `worktree` automatically.

### Preview what would be reviewed without running

```text
/review-sdlc --dry-run
```

---

## Configuration

The default scope can be persisted in `.claude/review.json`:

```json
{
  "defaults": {
    "scope": "worktree"
  }
}
```

**Scope resolution order:** CLI flag → `.claude/review.json` → `all` (hardcoded default)

Use `--set-default` to create or update this file without editing it manually:

```text
/review-sdlc --set-default --staged
```

Valid scope values: `all`, `committed`, `staged`, `working`, `worktree`.

## Consolidated Comment Format

The command posts a single PR comment:

```markdown
## Code Review — 3 dimension(s), 7 finding(s)

> Automated review by `sdlc:sdlc-reviewing-changes` · 2026-02-25

### Summary

| Dimension       | Findings | Critical | High | Medium | Low | Info |
|-----------------|----------|----------|------|--------|-----|------|
| security-review | 3        | 0        | 2    | 1      | 0   | 0    |
| code-quality    | 4        | 0        | 0    | 2      | 2   | 0    |
| **Total**       | **7**    | **0**    | **2**| **3**  | **2**| **0**|

### Verdict: APPROVED WITH NOTES

Two high-severity security findings require attention before merging.

### security-review — 3 finding(s)

<details>
<summary>0 critical · 2 high · 1 medium · 0 low · 0 info</summary>

#### [HIGH] Unvalidated user input passed to exec()
**File:** `src/handlers/deploy.ts:47`
User-supplied `command` parameter is passed directly to `child_process.exec()` without sanitization.
**Suggestion:** Use `execFile()` with a fixed command and pass arguments as an array.

## Dimension Suggestions

When the review finds changed files not covered by any active dimension, it analyzes their patterns and suggests new dimensions in the review plan output:

```text
Suggested new dimensions for uncovered files:

  ci-cd-pipeline-review — 2 CI/CD workflow files not covered
    Files: .github/workflows/ci.yml, .github/workflows/deploy.yml

  configuration-management-review — 3 configuration files not covered
    Files: src/config/db.ts, src/config/auth.ts, .env.example

Run `/review-init-sdlc --add` to create these dimensions.
```

Files that cannot be mapped to any known dimension type are listed separately:

```text
2 file(s) not mappable to any known dimension type:
  src/custom-runtime.xyz
  build-tool.conf
Consider creating a custom dimension or broadening existing trigger patterns.
```

These suggestions are informational during a review run. To act on them, run `/review-init-sdlc --add`.

---

## Prerequisites

- **`.claude/review-dimensions/`** — at least one dimension file must exist. Run `/review-init-sdlc` to create them.
- **`gh` CLI** — recommended for posting the PR comment. Falls back to terminal output if unavailable.
