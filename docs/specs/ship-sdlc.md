# ship-sdlc Specification

> End-to-end feature shipping pipeline: execute plan, commit, review, fix critical issues, version, and open a PR. Chains six sub-skills sequentially with conditional review-fix loop, state persistence, and resume support.

**User-invocable:** yes
**Model:** opus
**Prepare script:** `skill/ship.js`

## Arguments

- A1: `--auto` — run pipeline non-interactively; forwarded to sub-skills that support it (default: false)
- A2: `--skip <steps>` — comma-separated steps to skip; valid: execute, commit, review, received-review, commit-fixes, version, pr (default: from config or none)
- A3: `--preset full|balanced|minimal` — execution preset forwarded to execute-plan-sdlc (default: from config or balanced)
- A4: `--bump patch|minor|major` — version bump type forwarded to version-sdlc (default: from config or patch)
- A5: `--draft` — create PR as draft (default: from config or false)
- A6: `--dry-run` — display pipeline plan without executing (default: false)
- A7: `--resume` — resume pipeline from saved state file (default: false)
- A8: `--workspace branch|worktree|prompt` — workspace isolation mode (default: from config or prompt)
- A8a: In `--auto` mode, `workspace: "prompt"` is overridden to `"branch"` when the source is not `'cli'`. Explicit CLI `--workspace prompt` with `--auto` is preserved (intentional override).
- A9: `--init-config` — run interactive config wizard, no pipeline execution (default: false)
- A10: `--openspec-change <name>` — explicitly select the OpenSpec change to archive, overriding branch matching (default: null)

## Core Requirements

- R1: 7-step pipeline sequence: execute-plan-sdlc → commit-sdlc → review-sdlc → received-review-sdlc (conditional) → commit-sdlc fixes (conditional) → version-sdlc → pr-sdlc
- R2: All sub-skills dispatched as Agents (never Skill tool) to maintain context isolation — each Agent loads its SKILL.md independently
- R3: Pipeline plan is a binding contract: steps with `status: "will_run"` must execute; LLM cannot override
- R4: Step statuses computed by `skill/ship.js`: `will_run`, `skipped`, `conditional`
- R5: Skip set provenance tracked via `skipSource`: `cli`, `config`, `auto`, `condition`, `none`; fabrication guard blocks (error, exit code 1) on `default` source
- R6: Review verdict conditional logic: CHANGES REQUESTED (critical or ≥3 high) → pause, invoke received-review; APPROVED WITH NOTES (high or ≥5 medium) → invoke received-review if high exists; APPROVED → continue
- R7: `--auto` forwarding audit: only forwarded to commit-sdlc, received-review-sdlc, version-sdlc, pr-sdlc (not execute-plan-sdlc, not review-sdlc)
- R8: Staging gap between execute and commit: `git add -A -- ':!.sdlc/'` required
- R9: Rebase onto default branch after all commits, before version step; abort and pause on conflict
- R10: State persistence after each step via `state/ship.js`; cleanup validates pipeline contract before deleting state; state preserved on validation failure
- R11: Resume via `--resume`: re-enter worktree if applicable, continue from first incomplete step
- R12: Version step auto-skipped in worktree mode (tags are repo-global); advisory printed post-pipeline
- R13: Worktree PRs auto-label `skip-version-check` when version auto-skipped
- R14: Double commit intentional: feature commit (step 2) and review fix commit (step 5) kept separate
- R15: `--dry-run` displays pipeline table and stops without executing
- R16: `--init-config` redirects to `/setup-sdlc`; runs interactive wizard if user insists
- R17: Deferred review findings (medium/low) collected and displayed in final summary
- R18: Ship config is optional and developer-local (`.sdlc/local.json`); pipeline runs with built-in defaults
- R19: Prepare script output is the single authoritative source for all contracted fields (P-fields) — script-provided values take unconditional precedence over skill-generated content, and all factual context (git state, config, flags, metadata) must originate from script output to ensure deterministic behavior
- R20: `--auto` suppresses pipeline pauses: when `--auto` is active, `pause` must be `false` for every step that accepts `--auto` (per R7 forwarding audit: commit-sdlc, received-review-sdlc, version-sdlc, pr-sdlc). The sub-skill's consent gate is skipped via the forwarded flag, so the pipeline has no reason to pause at that step.
- R21: When `openspec/config.yaml` exists (as reported by `skill/ship.js` via `context.openspecDetected` or the authoritative field) AND the injected session-start `<system-reminder>` contains a contradictory signal (regex matching `not initialized` together with `openspec`), the skill MUST emit a single audit line naming the authoritative file path and note that the contradictory signal is being ignored. The override line is informational only — pipeline flow continues. (Rationale: #164 — defensive hardening against co-installed plugins emitting false-negative OpenSpec detection.)
- R22: The pipeline includes a conditional `archive-openspec` step between `commit-fixes` and `version`. The step has no dedicated sub-skill — it is dispatched inline via bash (validation + archive + commit).
- R23: Trigger conditions for `archive-openspec` (all must hold): `openspec/config.yaml` exists; an active non-archived change matches the current branch (`openspec.branchMatch`) OR `--openspec-change <name>` is passed; prior steps completed without halting.
- R24: The `archive-openspec` step calls `openspec validate <name> --strict` via `lib/openspec.js::validateChangeStrict`; on failure, halts the pipeline and surfaces validation output.
- R25: On validation success: prompts the user (non-interactive in `--auto`); on approval (or `--auto`), runs `openspec archive <name> --yes` via `lib/openspec.js::runArchive`, then creates a commit `chore(openspec): archive <name>`.
- R26: `--skip archive-openspec` disables the step. The value is added to `VALID_SKIP` in `ship-fields.js`.
- R27: The step is idempotent — if `lib/openspec.js::isArchived(projectRoot, changeName)` returns true, the step is skipped with reason "already archived".
- R28: `--openspec-change <name>` flag explicitly selects the change to archive, overriding branch matching.
- R29: The ship config schema MUST NOT contain a `preset` field. The decorative `preset` (`full|balanced|minimal`) is replaced by an explicit `steps[]` list in `.sdlc/local.json`. CLI flag `--preset <X>` is preserved as legacy sugar that expands to `steps[]` at parse time; it is never persisted as `preset` in the config file.
  - Acceptance: `schemas/sdlc-local.schema.json` `shipSection` contains no `preset` property; `lib/ship-fields.js` `SHIP_FIELDS` contains no `preset` field; `BUILT_IN_DEFAULTS` contains no `preset` key.
- R30: The ship config schema MUST NOT contain a `skip` field. The single source of truth for which steps run is `steps[]`; CLI flag `--skip <step,…>` is preserved as legacy sugar that subtracts from the resolved `steps[]` at parse time. It is never persisted in the config file.
  - Acceptance: `schemas/sdlc-local.schema.json` `shipSection` contains no `skip` property; `lib/ship-fields.js` `SHIP_FIELDS` contains no `skip` field; `BUILT_IN_DEFAULTS` contains no `skip` key.
- R31: Top-level local config files (`.sdlc/local.json`) MUST carry an integer `version` field. Current schema version is `2`. The schema declares `"version": {"type": "integer", "const": 2}` at the top level. Files lacking `version` are treated as v1 and auto-migrated on read.
  - Acceptance: `schemas/sdlc-local.schema.json` declares top-level `version` with `const: 2`; new configs written via `writeLocalConfig`/`util/ship-init.js` include `version: 2` at the top level (not nested in `ship`).
- R32: `lib/config.js::readLocalConfig` MUST auto-migrate v1 → v2 on read. Migration steps: (a) expand legacy `ship.preset` to `steps[]` via `PRESET_TO_STEPS` (full/balanced/minimal and legacy A/B/C aliases); (b) subtract any legacy `ship.skip[]` members from the expanded steps; (c) delete `ship.preset` and `ship.skip` from the in-memory object; (d) set `ship.steps = <result>` and top-level `version: 2`; (e) persist the migrated config back atomically; (f) emit a single stderr deprecation notice on first migration. Migration MUST be idempotent — reading a v2 config does not rewrite or re-emit. The `migrateConfig` (--migrate) flow also triggers the v1→v2 ship migration.
  - Acceptance: passing `{$schema, ship:{preset:"balanced", skip:[]}}` (no version) to `readLocalConfig` returns `{version:2, ship:{steps:[execute,commit,review,pr,archive-openspec], …}}` and rewrites disk; passing the migrated result back to `readLocalConfig` returns identical content with no disk write and no second notice.
- R33: The setup-sdlc questionnaire (`shipFields` from `lib/ship-fields.js`) MUST emit a `steps` field (multi-select; options enumerate the six canonical steps `execute, commit, review, version, pr, archive-openspec`; default = all six). It MUST NOT emit `preset` or `skip` fields. `util/ship-init.js` MUST consume `--steps <csv>` (validated against `VALID_STEPS`) and write a config whose top level carries `version: 2`. The `--preset` flag MUST be removed from `ship-init.js` and rejected with a clear migration-pointer error if passed.
  - Acceptance: `SHIP_FIELDS[0].name === 'steps'`; `ship-init.js --steps execute,commit,pr` produces a `.sdlc/local.json` whose top level has `version: 2` and `ship.steps: ["execute","commit","pr"]`, no `preset`/`skip` keys.

## Workflow Phases

1. CONSUME — load config, parse flags, run `skill/ship.js` for context detection and step computation
   - **Script:** `skill/ship.js`
   - **Params:** A1-A8 forwarded (`--auto`, `--skip <csv>`, `--preset`, `--bump`, `--draft`, `--resume`, `--workspace`); internal: `--has-plan` (from plan context detection)
   - **Output:** JSON → P1-P6 (flags with per-flag provenance sources, resume detection, context with branch/auth/openspec/worktree, pipeline steps with status/reason/skipSource/invocation, config)
2. PLAN — build pipeline table from `skill/ship.js` steps array; display flag resolution and auto-skip decisions
3. CRITIQUE — validate pipeline: gh auth, branch safety, skip values, flag coherence
4. DO — present pipeline for confirmation (or auto/dry-run); execute steps sequentially via Agent dispatch
   - **Script:** `state/ship.js`
   - **Params:** subcommands per step lifecycle: `init`, `start`, `complete`, `skip`, `fail`, `decide`, `defer`
   - **Output:** JSON state object persisted to `.sdlc/execution/ship-<branch>-<timestamp>.json` for `--resume` support
5. REPORT — summary table with per-step results, decisions log, deferred findings, worktree cleanup
   - **Script:** `state/ship.js`
   - **Params:** subcommand `cleanup` (on success) or `read` (on failure, state preserved)
   - **Output:** state file removed on success; preserved on failure for `--resume`

## Quality Gates

- G1: `gh` CLI authenticated — `gh auth status` succeeds
- G2: Not on default branch — warn if on main/master (do not block)
- G3: Skip values valid — all `--skip` values are recognized step names
- G4: At least one step will run — pipeline is not entirely skipped
- G5: Flag coherence — `--bump` without version step produces error (exit code 1, blocking)
- G6: Pipeline contract — every `will_run` step was dispatched as Agent
- G6a: Pipeline completion gate — `state/ship.js cleanup` validates all steps are in terminal state (`completed`, `skipped`, or `failed`) before deleting the state file. Steps still `pending` or `in_progress` cause cleanup to refuse deletion and exit 1.
- G7: Staging gap filled — `git add -A -- ':!.sdlc/'` ran between execute and commit
- G8: Rebase attempted — rebase ran after commits, before version (when applicable)

## Prepare Script Contract

- P1: `flags` (object) — resolved flags with `sources` map showing CLI/config/default provenance per flag
- P2: `resume` (object) — `{ found, stateFile }` resume detection result
- P3: `context` (object) — `{ planInContext, uncommittedChanges, currentBranch, defaultBranch, ghAuth, openspec, sdlcGitignored, worktree }`
- P4: `steps` (array) — pipeline steps, each with `{ skill, status, reason, skipSource, args, invocation, pause }`
- P5: `steps[].invocation` (string) — exact skill name + computed args for Agent dispatch
- P6: `config` (object | null) — ship config from `.sdlc/local.json` or null if absent
- P7: `steps[].model` (string) — model for Agent dispatch per step, computed from skill specs (e.g., `"sonnet"` for review-sdlc, `"haiku"` for commit-sdlc)

## Error Handling

- E1: Sub-skill fails (script crash) → stop pipeline, save state for `--resume`; sub-skill handles its own error reporting
- E2: `gh auth status` fails → stop at validation, tell user to `gh auth login`
- E3: `git add` fails → stop pipeline, show error
- E4: Network error (gh API) → auto-retry 3 attempts with exponential backoff; if exhausted, save state
- E5: State file write fails → warn and continue (best-effort)
- E6: Resume state file corrupt → warn, start fresh
- E7: Review verdict unparseable → treat as APPROVED WITH NOTES, warn user
- E8: Rebase conflict → abort rebase; auto mode stops, interactive offers pause/skip/merge options
- E9: Sub-skill times out → stop pipeline, save state

## Constraints

- C1: Must not invoke sub-skills via Skill tool — all dispatched as Agents for context isolation
- C2: Must not skip critique step (Step 3)
- C3: Must not forward `--auto` to sub-skills that don't support it (execute-plan-sdlc, review-sdlc)
- C4: Must not automatically resolve review findings — received-review-sdlc handles this
- C5: Must not run pipeline steps in parallel — strictly sequential
- C6: Must not delete state file on failure — needed for `--resume`
- C7: Must not proceed past a failed sub-skill — stop, save state, inform user
- C8: Must not skip steps marked `will_run` in the pipeline plan — the plan is a binding contract
- C9: Must not copy example args from SKILL.md — use `step.invocation` from skill/ship.js
- C10: Must not add `--skip` flags not present in user invocation or ship config
- C11: Must not skip, bypass, or defer prepare script execution — the script must run and exit successfully before any skill phase begins
- C12: Must not override, reinterpret, or discard prepare script output — for every P-field, the script return value is authoritative and final; the skill must not substitute LLM-generated alternatives
- C13: Must not independently compute, infer, or fabricate values for any field the prepare script is contracted to provide — if the script fails or a field is absent, the skill must stop rather than fill in data
- C14: Must not re-derive data the prepare script already computes via shell commands, tool calls, or LLM inference — script output is the sole source for all factual context, preserving deterministic behavior

## Step-Emitter Contract

> Added as foundation for step-emitter migration. P-TRANS-1 transition map to be defined during script migration.

- P-STEP-1: Script returns universal envelope with `status`, `step`, `llm_decision`, `state_file`, `progress`, and `ext` fields on every invocation
- P-STEP-2: Script accepts `--after <step_id> --result-file <path> --state <state_file>` for subsequent invocations after the initial call
- P-STEP-3: State file is created on first invocation, updated after each step, and cleaned up when status is `"done"`
- P-TRANS-1: Step transition map — TBD (to be defined during script migration)
- P-TRANS-2: Every `step.id` in the transition map has a corresponding `When step.id == X` section in SKILL.md
- C-STEP-1: The LLM MUST NOT skip steps or reorder the sequence — the script controls progression
- C-STEP-2: The LLM MUST NOT read or modify the state file directly — it passes the path back to the script via `--state`
- C-STEP-3: When `llm_decision` is null, the LLM executes the step without asking the user or making judgment calls
- C-STEP-4: When `llm_decision` is non-null, the LLM MUST resolve it (via domain knowledge or user interaction) before proceeding

## Integration

- I1: `skill/ship.js` — pre-computes flags, context, step statuses, and invocations
- I2: `state/ship.js` — pipeline state management for pause/resume
- I3: `util/ship-init.js` — interactive config wizard for `--init-config`
- I4: `execute-plan-sdlc` — step 1: plan execution
- I5: `commit-sdlc` — steps 2 and 5: feature commit and review fix commit
- I6: `review-sdlc` — step 3: multi-dimension code review
- I7: `received-review-sdlc` — step 4 (conditional): process review findings
- I8: `version-sdlc` — step 6: semantic versioning and release tag
- I9: `pr-sdlc` — step 7: pull request creation
- I10: `setup-sdlc` — redirect target for `--init-config`
- I11: `util/worktree-create.js` — worktree creation for workspace isolation
- I12: OpenSpec — optional; suggests `/opsx:verify` and `/opsx:archive` post-pipeline when detected
- I13: `lib/openspec.js` — `validateChangeStrict`, `isArchived`, `runArchive` helpers for the `archive-openspec` step
