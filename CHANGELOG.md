# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- harvest-learnings: `harvest-learnings.js` now reads from `.sdlc/learnings/log.md` (canonical path per #231 spec); legacy `.claude/learnings/log.md` triggers a one-version stderr deprecation fallback; `migrate-learnings-log.js` available for one-shot migration (#356)
- ship-sdlc: post-PR CI verification and remote-review awaiting are now opt-in via `ship.steps[]` entries (`verify-pipeline`, `await-remote-review`). Boolean flags `ship.verifyPipeline` / `ship.awaitReview` removed; CLI flags `--verify-pipeline` / `--await-review` removed (passing them now produces a clear migration-pointer error). Schema bumped v3 → v4 with auto-migration on first read.

## [0.21.6] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- execute-plan-sdlc: harden nested-dispatch sentinel to prevent double-dispatching when running inside a subagent context; docs updated to reflect the new behavior (#463)

## [0.21.5] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- ship-sdlc: Restore workspace field-path read from `flags.workspace` (correct, per R60 spec) instead of `context.workspace` (non-existent field) (#451)

## [0.21.4] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- plan-sdlc: per-task `Contract:` block with type-aware decided shape (code/docs/openspec columns); G18 gate (content-coverage lane settlement/contract concreteness check) (#459)
- execute-plan-sdlc: verbatim consumption of Contract fields from task metadata (#459)

### Fixed
- execute-plan-sdlc: Contract extraction parsing guidance added; per-task fact sheet Contract field flow documented (#459)

## [0.21.3] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- sdlc: OpenSpec scans now route through the active worktree — plan, ship, and explore operations in linked worktrees detect their own OpenSpec changes instead of the main worktree's empty state (#457)

### Fixed
- openspec-scan-worktree: disabled GPG signing in test fixture to prevent CI failures when GPG signing is globally configured (#457)

## [0.21.1] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- ship-sdlc: WIP commit squashing — the pipeline now detects and squashes execute-plan-sdlc work-in-progress commits, allowing continuation to subsequent steps (#454)
- harden-sdlc: dimension-to-instructions generator for Copilot path-specific instructions (Step 5b, R45-R52) (#454)

### Fixed
- harden-sdlc: mirror gate clarified — "already exists" branch covers only manually pre-seeded mirrors; normal add-flow and strengthen proposals are excluded (#456)
- dimension-to-instructions: `readStdin` catch block now writes errors to stderr instead of silently swallowing them (#456)

## [0.21.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- ship-sdlc: workspace auto-detected from cwd and current branch — removed `--workspace`/`--branch`/`--tree` flags; six hooks deleted, reducing total hook count to 7
- ship-sdlc: `--auto` continuation broadened via `pipelineAdvancing()` predicate so the pipeline advances across steps in a single turn

### Fixed
- ship-sdlc: corrected stale `--branch` prose in execute-plan-sdlc docs and SKILL.md; added jira-sdlc DO NOT note reinforcing `AskUserQuestion` gate after hook removal

## [0.20.36] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- ship-sdlc: pipeline continuation — PostToolUse hook emits in-progress context, Stop hook blocks auto-run when a step is in progress, and begin-step/complete-step state subcommands atomically persist per-step progress for TodoWrite task rendering (#452)

## [0.20.35] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- ship-sdlc: worktree in-place guard — when ship is launched from inside a linked worktree with `--workspace worktree`, the mode automatically downgrades to continue and runs in place, making the manual "create worktree → write plan → ship" workflow work without explicit `--workspace continue` (#449)

## [0.20.34] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- review-sdlc: split review manifest into thin index and per-dimension slice files to bound orchestrator context on large changesets, preventing context overflow (#447)

## [0.20.33] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- plan-sdlc: opsx:verify methodology integration — Gate A intake audit (completeness/correctness/coherence checks before decomposition), Gate B verification scorecard (traceability matrix and Go/no-go verdict at plan audit), requirement inventory via openspec delta tracking, and verdict-to-action mapping (CRITICAL findings block decomposition) (#445)

## [0.20.32] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- ship-sdlc: progressive-disclosure pattern for context reduction — extracted cold sections (--init-config, --gc, --dry-run handlers, workspace isolation setup, error recovery, DO NOT, Gotchas, Learning Capture) into companion docs (entry-modes.md, workspace-worktree.md, reference.md)

### Fixed
- ship-sdlc: entry-modes failure guard for --init-config and --gc; spec companion file names enumerated in R-progressive-disclosure; skills-meta stale description corrected

### Changed
- ship-sdlc SKILL.md: reduced from ~1209 to ~992 lines; users read companion docs on-demand

## [0.20.31] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- verify-openspec step for ship-sdlc to validate OpenSpec changes during release workflow

- received-review: completeness gate hardening and spec/doc sync (#432)

## [0.20.26] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- received-review: meta-analysis of evaluated findings clustered by hardening surface and target, with auto-dispatch to harden-sdlc for approved findings (#429)
- ship-sdlc: TodoWrite integration for real-time pipeline step visibility during release execution (#427)

## [0.20.25] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- ship-sdlc: TodoWrite integration for pipeline step visibility — surface each step and substep as tasks in the task tray during release execution for real-time progress tracking (#427)
- execute-plan-sdlc: task mirroring for plan waves — each wave's substeps are converted to TodoWrite tasks and synchronized during execution (#427)

### Fixed
- ship-sdlc: todo visibility substep refinement — resolved substeps are closed atomically when a step fails, ensuring accurate task-tray state (#427)

## [0.20.24] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- jira-sdlc: project-local template overrides migrate automatically from `.claude/jira-templates/` to `.sdlc/jira-templates/` on first use; one-shot idempotent migration shim available via `/setup-sdlc --migrate` (#423)
- setup-sdlc: verifies installed pipeline-script files are at-or-above the version expected by the running plugin; surfaces outdated files with a warning and migration prompt (#424)
- version-sdlc: `--retag` flag retags the current resolved version at HEAD — deletes local and remote tag, recreates annotated tag, and pushes; incompatible with bump types and `--init`/`--changelog`/`--hotfix` (#424)

### Fixed
- harden-sdlc: `harden-prepare.js` now uses `spawnSync` with an argv array instead of `execSync` with shell string interpolation, preventing command injection via branch names containing shell metacharacters
- jira-sdlc: SKILL.md HELPER blocks for `mcp-failure.js` now guarded with stderr `WARNING:` prefix to prevent silent failure swallowing in MCP contexts
- harden-sdlc: SKILL.md plugin-defect routing phrasing normalized for consistency across all dispatch sites

## [0.18.6] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- script resolution: all skills now pick the newest installed plugin version using `sort -V | tail -1` instead of `head -1`, preventing arbitrary cache version selection when multiple versions are installed; downstream symptoms (#261–#264) where `/setup-sdlc` reported config sections as [not set] are also resolved (#258)
- execute-plan-sdlc: renamed internal `SCRIPT` variable to `STATE_SCRIPT` in state-persistence block to eliminate silent variable shadowing

## [0.17.40] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- setup-sdlc: corrected review dimension file count to look for `.md` files instead of `.yaml`/`.yml`, fixing dimensions always reporting a count of 0 (#203)

## [0.17.39] - 2026-05-05

### Added
- review-sdlc: per-dimension model override — dimension frontmatter can declare a `model` field that overrides the manifest's `subagent_model` for that dimension; orchestrator dispatch uses `dimension.model || manifest.subagent_model` (R15) (#199)
